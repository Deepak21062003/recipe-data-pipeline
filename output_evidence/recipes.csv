- This recipe makes a slightly chunky curry since chopped onions are used but it is creamy. If you want a smooth curry, simply add the sautéed onions to the tomatoes and blend them. But avoid using red onions if you want to puree them.
- Prepare the mushrooms only when you are ready to use them. I usually do that while cooking the onions and tomatoes.
- It is not essential to saute the mushrooms but some kinds of mushrooms won’t taste good without this step. So do what you like.
- If using small mushrooms, you don’t need to trim the stems as they are not woody and fibrous. But if you are using medium to larger mushrooms, trim off the stems as they can taste woody and fibrous. They will remain under cooked in the curry.

- Take it away from the candle – place it inside the bowl. Add two and one-half ml ghee or oil.
- Immediately it begins to emit smoke.
- Make sure charcoal is not touching the food. Cover the pan with a lid immediately. Leave it for 5 to 6 minutes. This infuses a smoky flavor to your dish.
- To a mixing bowl, add yogurt, red chili powder, ginger garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric, kasuri methi, oil, lemon juice & salt.
- Mix well and taste test it. Add more salt if required. Add paneer cubes & gently mix well to coat the paneer with the marinade.

- Pour the onion tomato puree. (Careful as it may splash). At this step, taste test and add more red chilli powder if you want to achieve a brighter color.
- Pour water to bring this to a gravy consistency. Cook covered until the gravy turns thick for about 10 mins and you see traces of oil on top. Keep stirring in between.
- Once the gravy is thick yet of a pouring consistency, you may remove and discard the whole spices. Crush the kasuri methi in your palms and sprinkle it. (optional). Taste the gravy & add more salt if needed. Rest this aside.
- Option 1 – Grill in oven . Preheat the oven to 430 F or 220 C for at least 15 mins. Line a baking tray with foil. Thread paneer, onion & bell peppers alternately on skewers. Place the skewers in the baking tray & grill for 8 to 10 minutes, turning them to the other side after 5 mins. Remove them when golden and crisp.
- Option 2 – To make on griddle . Heat a tsp oil in a wide pan on a high flame, coat each paneer piece with the marinade & place on the griddle. Cook on a high flame till the marinade dries up and paneer turns golden. Similarly place the bell peppers and marinated onions and fry until the marinade dries up.

16,Chicken Chettinad Gravy Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Bone-in chicken is favored for the extra flavor the bones produce. Traditionally, whole chicken that’s cut-up to smaller portions (curry-cut) is used. But if you don’t prefer that, you may use boneless chicken breast or thighs that are cut up to 1one-half inch portions. Cut down the cook time else they can dry out & overcook.
- You can make the dry spice blend without coconut to store for 3 months in the refrigerator or for 1 month at room temperature.
- You can make the Chettinad masala paste ahead and refrigerate for a week. Beyond the mentioned time, the spice blend begins to lose the flavors.
- Traditionally chicken is not marinated, but I prefer to do that as it removes the poultry smell. Yogurt or lemon juice helps do that and the spices in the marinade season the chicken well at this stage.
- Chettinad curry is not a tomato based curry, so you may cut down the amount of tomatoes if you want.
- It is essential to grind the spices super smooth else you will find the gravy gritty. Chicken cooks faster than mutton, so the gravy won’t get a lot of time to cook down & soften the grits.
- Marinate chicken with chili powder, turmeric, salt, ginger garlic and lemon juice or yogurt. Cover and rest aside until needed.
- To a pan, add red chilies, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, dagad phool, black pepper corn, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds and cardamoms.
- Heat on a medium flame for 2 mins. Reduce to low and roast until crunchy and golden, for 7 to 8 mins. Do not burn and keep stirring constantly. Remove to cool down.
- Add coconut, half of the curry leaves and half tablespoon oil to the same pan and roast until light golden, for 7 to 8 mins. Turn off.
- Transfer all the roasted spices and make a fine powder. Your chettinad masala is ready. To make the paste, add coconut, curry leaves and cashews if using to the same grinder jar. Pour half cup cold water and make a super smooth paste. This is Chettinad masala paste.
- Heat oil in a pan, add bay leaf (optional) and onions. Saute until the onions turn light golden, for 7 to 8 mins.
- Add the chicken and fry on a high heat for at least 4 to 5 mins.
- Stir in the tomatoes. (and red chili powder if using). Saute until the raw smell of tomatoes is gone and the oil begins to ooze out of the tomatoes.
- Stir in the rest of the curry leaves and transfer the ground Chettinad masala paste and hot water.
- Mix well and simmer covered until the chicken is cooked through. A meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken should read 165 F or 75 C.
- Taste test and adjust salt to your liking. If the gravy is runny, evaporate some of the liquid by cooking on a high heat.
- Serve chicken chettinad gravy with rice, chapatti, idli, dosa and appam.
- If you prefer a low-heat dish, I highly recommend substituting dried red chilies with Kashmiri red chili powder. Sometimes whole chilies can make your dish super hot.
- Either add the chili powder to the grinder when you grind the masala or add it to the pan directly when you add the tomatoes.
- If you love your dish to be bright in color like seen in the pictures, use 1/4 to half teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder and cut down the dried chilies.

75,Aloo Gobi Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Peel & cube 2 medium potatoes to make 1one hundred and twenty g pieces of three-quarters by three-quarters inch each. Keep them immersed in water until required.
- Chop a cauliflower head, to make four hundred and eighty g (one hundred and eighty g) florets, chopped to 1one-half inch. Optionally add the florets to slightly hot water and rest for 3 to 4 mins. Later rinse them well and drain.
- Fine chop 1 medium onion, to make three-quarters to two hundred and forty g chopped onions
- Deseed & fine chop 2 medium tomatoes to make three-quarters to two hundred and forty g (or sixty g canned tomato puree (without citric acid) or use thirty g tomato paste stirred with forty five ml water)
- Always sauté & cook potatoes until half done before adding the cauliflower. Potatoes take longer to cook than cauliflower so avoid adding them together to the pan.
- Do not add salt till the potatoes are almost done. Adding salt will prevent them from cooking well since there is not much water used.
- The latter part of cooking has to be done on a low flame which helps the veggies to release some moisture and cook well without burning.
- If using tomatoes do not add them until the potatoes are soft cooked. The acidity in tomatoes will prevent the aloo from cooking faster.
- This can be made without onion, tomatoes, garlic & even green chili. I do make this baby version for my young boys as they are fussy to eat it with all those ingredients.
- My recipe shared here has all of the above ingredients and makes the best aloo gobi. However leaving out onion or tomatoes is just okay and the dish still turns out good. Leaving out both makes the dish very dry so use more oil.
- For a quicker version, just toss potatoes and cauliflower in spice powders along with little oil. Then bake them in a oven or air fryer. Make the onion tomato masala and then add the baked potatoes and cauliflower to the masala.
- Chop cauliflower florets to 1one-half inch in size. Add them to slightly hot water and set aside for 3 to 4 mins.
- Drain the water and rinse them well. Drain them completely.
- Cube potatoes to three-quarters by three-quarters inch. or you can also slice them to three-quarters inch. Keep them immersed in a bowl of water until used. Keeping them in water helps the potatoes to cook faster as they soak up some moisture.
- Mince ginger and garlic. Keep this aside.
- Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. When they sizzle, add ginger garlic & saute for 30 seconds.
- Then add the onions & stir fry until transparent.
- Add the potatoes and green chilli. Stir fry for 2 to 3 mins. Cover and cook on a low to medium heat until they are half done. If required you can splash some water so they cook faster.
- Keep stirring in between and cook covered.
- When they are slightly tender but still under cooked, add the cauliflower & stir fry for about 3 mins.
- Add red chilli powder, turmeric, roasted cumin powder, garam masala and coriander powder.
- Mix well. Sprinkle 2 to forty five ml water all over the aloo gobi or across the sides of the pan & mix well. This step helps keep the aloo gobi moist without drying out.
- Cook covered, stirring every few minutes, until both aloo & gobi are almost fork tender. Add salt and continue to cook covered on a low flame until the potatoes are soft & fully cooked.
- The veggies will release moisture at this stage and cook quickly. So keep an eye not to over cook gobi at this stage. It must remain slightly crunchy yet cooked.
- Next add the tomatoes and kasuri methi. Fry on a medium to high flame until the raw smell of tomatoes is gone.
- If needed add little oil at this stage. It takes about 2 to 4 mins for the raw smell of tomatoes to go away.
- Sprinkle amchur if using. Finally garnish aloo gobi with coriander leaves. Sprinkle some lemon juice if you want. Serve with rice, roti or any bread.
- I have updated the recipe to prevent the aloo gobi drying out. Simply sprinkle some water as you cook.
- This recipe has been updated to make it more flavorsome.
- A heavy bottom pan with a lid works well for this dish.

76,Baingan Bharta Recipe (Eggplant Bharta),,"prep_step:
- Rinse eggplants well under running water and wipe dry with a kitchen tissue. Make 4 slits on the brinjal. If you want to use the garlic & chili – push the garlic cloves deep inside 2 slits. Also push the slit green chilies in the other 2 slits. Brush them with oil.
- On Direct Fire : With the help of a tong, place it on direct fire. You can do it either on the red hot coal or stovetop. Keep turning it to all the other sides and grill until it is done completely roasted & cooked through. It takes about 12 to 14 mins.
- To grill in oven : Line a metal tray with foil. Cut each eggplant to 2 parts and place them on the tray with the skin side on top. You can also place the tomatoes in the same tray. Broil/Grill them at 460 F or 240 C for 16 to 20 mins.
- In air fryer : Place baingan, chilies, garlic and tomatoes in the air fryer basket. Air fry at 400 F or 200 C. It takes roughly about 22 mins for the whole eggplant, 16 mins if you halve the eggplant & air fry.
- Once done, check by inserting a fork into the eggplant. It should go in smoothly & easily meaning it is soft and cooked well. (Check step-by-step photos above)
- Cool the eggplant and peel the skin. Optionally – Transfer the eggplant to a bowl and cover it for 5 mins. Once done remove the skin.
- Mash or chop the eggplant, grilled garlic and green chilies. Keep these aside. Peel and chop the tomatoes, onions and raw garlic as well.
- Pour oil to a hot pan. When the oil turns hot, add chopped ginger and garlic. Saute for 30 to 60 seconds until aromatic.
- Stir in the chopped onions and saute until they turn light golden, for 6 to 7 mins.
- Add tomatoes and salt. Cook until they become soft for 5 to 6 mins. Add red chili powder and cook for a few minutes until the raw smell from the tomatoes is gone, for 1 to 2 mins.

- Serve baingan bharta with roti, rice or naan.
- I love using extra garlic and chilies so I stuff the eggplants with some garlic cloves and chilies. If you don’t want, you may omit.
- Traditional bharta does not use garam masala as the charcoal grilled eggplants have a unique flavor of their own. Since I do not grill my eggplants on charcoal grill we do prefer garam masala. However it is a personal preference and you may omit it if you don’t like or simply use coriander powder along with red chili powder.
- For extra heat (spice) in the dish, you can use more green chilies. Adding more red chili powder will alter the flavor of the bharta.
- You can add half teaspoon cumin seeds to the oil before frying the ginger garlic.
- Use eggplants that have a smooth and glossy skin. Avoid over-matured eggplants with lots of seeds.
- After grilling the eggplants if you find seeds inside, just scoop them out and discard.
- For more authentic flavors & taste, grill eggplants on red hot coal.

- To a small mixing bowl, add mayonnaise or Greek yogurt, mustard, olive oil, garlic, chilli flakes and black pepper. Taste test and add salt if needed. If your mayo is not sour add lemon juice as well. Mix and refrigerate until needed later.
- Pour 2 one-half to seven hundred and twenty ml water to a steamer/ cooker or a pot. Place a trivet or a rack inside the pot. Cover and bring the water to a boil.
- Meanwhile rinse potatoes & French beans. Trim off both ends of French beans and fine chop them. Peel and cube potatoes to 1 inch pieces. Add them to a steamer basket and place them in the steamer.
- Steam them until half done for about 5 to 7 mins. Meanwhile, peel and chop carrots to 1 inch pieces.
- When the potatoes are half done, transfer carrots & peas to the steamer. Cover and steam them until potatoes are done completely and fork tender. Even peas and carrots should be done by now.
- Cool all these steamed veggies and transfer to a mixing bowl. Once cool mash them well and then add garam masala, coriander powder, green chilies, coriander leaves and salt.
- Mix all of them. You will have a mushy and sticky mixture. To this add, bread crumbs or powdered poha or flour in batches only as needed.
- The mixture for the patties must not be too soggy or too moist. Slight stickiness is alright but it has to be firm. If not add more bread crumbs. Check pictures in the step by step photo section in the post.
- Taste test the mixture and add more salt or any seasoning if you prefer. Divide the dough to 4 to 6 portions depending on how thick or thin you want the patties to be.
- To a small mixing bowl, add gram flour or corn starch to make the batter. Add a pinch of salt & pour water just enough to make a fairly thick batter. Do not make the batter runny as the excess moisture will be soaked up by the patties making them too soft.
- Pour bread crumbs or panko crumbs to a wide bowl or plate.
- Take one portion of the vegetable patty mixture and flatten it to the same size as your burger bun. If the mixture is sticking. Place the patty in some flour or corn starch. This way make all the patties and place them aside in a plate.
- Dip each patty in the batter completely and then place them in the bread crumbs. Coat the patty well with the crumbs including the sides.
- This way coat all the patties and set them aside. Rest these for 10 mins so the crumbs stick well to the patties and don’t mess the oil/ pan while frying.
- Rinse each lettuce leaf separately under a slow stream of running water. You may also sprinkle a solution of 1 part vinegar mixed with 3 parts of water. Rinse well and let them sit of kitchen tissues so all of the water drips away.
- Slice onions and tomatoes to round thin slices. If needed deseed the tomatoes.
- Refer notes section to bake or air fry the patties. To pan fry , heat a pan with 1one-half to thirty ml oil. Let the oil become hot, then place 2 to 3 patties as many as your pan fits. Rotate the patties with your fingers gently to coat the patties with the oil.
- Fry them on a medium high heat until the base turns golden and crisp. Flip them gently and pour 1 one-half to thirty ml oil as needed. Fry until crisp & uniformly golden. For a proper golden to brown crust, increase the flame the last 2 mins.
- To shallow fry , pour one hundred and twenty ml oil to a small pan and heat it. When the oil becomes hot, gently place the patties in the hot oil & fry until golden.
- Gently turn them to the other side and fry until golden & crisp. Remove them to a wired rack to cool slightly before assembling. To make cheese burgers, place cheese slices over the very hot patties.
- Once done with frying the patties, transfer the oil to a cup. Slice each bun to 2 parts and spread some butter on the buns if you prefer. Toast them in the same hot pan. Remove them and set aside.
- Before assembling please recheck – Lettuce should not have any water dripping, patties not too hot and the burger bun is also not hot.
- Place the toasted bun in a serving tray and then the veggie patty. Optionally spread the burger sauce we made earlier or some ketchup to keep the patty in place. However this is optional & skip if you want your patty very crisp.
- Place the lettuce, then the onion and tomatoes. Optionally drizzle some sauce over the lettuce and onions if you like. Spread more sauce over the top slice of your bun and place it over the burger.
- Burgers are ready to serve. Potato wedges, boiled corn, cheese balls are some of the great sides.
- Vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potatoes & sweet corn can also be used. Just steam them with other veggies.
- Mushrooms and spinach can be sautéed, chopped finely & then added to the mashed vegetables for patties.
- To make the patties completely breadcrumb free, use powdered poha, roasted gram flour (sattu), roasted besan or crushed cornflakes for binding. For the crumb coating, use powdered poha or crushed cornflakes.
- Spice them with any seasoning you like.
- Use vegan yogurt like this almond yogurt , eggless mayo or any vegan mayonnaise like nut mayo.
- Simply skip mayo and use guacamole or cream cheese or just any vegan cheese.

cook_step:
- salt (use a bit, only if needed)
- To a small mixing bowl, add mayonnaise or Greek yogurt, mustard, olive oil, garlic, chilli flakes and black pepper. Taste test and add salt if needed. If your mayo is not sour add lemon juice as well. Mix and refrigerate until needed later.
- Pour 2 one-half to seven hundred and twenty ml water to a steamer/ cooker or a pot. Place a trivet or a rack inside the pot. Cover and bring the water to a boil.
- Meanwhile rinse potatoes & French beans. Trim off both ends of French beans and fine chop them. Peel and cube potatoes to 1 inch pieces. Add them to a steamer basket and place them in the steamer.
- Steam them until half done for about 5 to 7 mins. Meanwhile, peel and chop carrots to 1 inch pieces.
- When the potatoes are half done, transfer carrots & peas to the steamer. Cover and steam them until potatoes are done completely and fork tender. Even peas and carrots should be done by now.
- Cool all these steamed veggies and transfer to a mixing bowl. Once cool mash them well and then add garam masala, coriander powder, green chilies, coriander leaves and salt.
- Mix all of them. You will have a mushy and sticky mixture. To this add, bread crumbs or powdered poha or flour in batches only as needed.
- The mixture for the patties must not be too soggy or too moist. Slight stickiness is alright but it has to be firm. If not add more bread crumbs. Check pictures in the step by step photo section in the post.
- Taste test the mixture and add more salt or any seasoning if you prefer. Divide the dough to 4 to 6 portions depending on how thick or thin you want the patties to be.
- To a small mixing bowl, add gram flour or corn starch to make the batter. Add a pinch of salt & pour water just enough to make a fairly thick batter. Do not make the batter runny as the excess moisture will be soaked up by the patties making them too soft.
- Pour bread crumbs or panko crumbs to a wide bowl or plate.
- Take one portion of the vegetable patty mixture and flatten it to the same size as your burger bun. If the mixture is sticking. Place the patty in some flour or corn starch. This way make all the patties and place them aside in a plate.
- Dip each patty in the batter completely and then place them in the bread crumbs. Coat the patty well with the crumbs including the sides.
- This way coat all the patties and set them aside. Rest these for 10 mins so the crumbs stick well to the patties and don’t mess the oil/ pan while frying.
- Rinse each lettuce leaf separately under a slow stream of running water. You may also sprinkle a solution of 1 part vinegar mixed with 3 parts of water. Rinse well and let them sit of kitchen tissues so all of the water drips away.

80,Navratan Korma Recipe (Navratan Curry),,"prep_step:
- I haven’t used yogurt or milk in this recipe. But you can always use one of them. To incorporate milk or yogurt, simply blend the onions and cashews with either sixty ml yogurt or sixty ml milk to a smooth paste.
- Yogurt adds a mild tang to the korma and milk adds a different rich flavor.
- To make the recipe vegan, use more cashews, skip cream and paneer. Or you can also substitute cream with coconut cream and paneer with tofu.
- A lot of restaurants use canned pineapple for garnish. They taste sweet & delicious because they are canned with sugar syrup. If using fresh pineapple make sure it is ripe and sweet. Also adding sour pineapple is likely to split your korma since cream has been added to it.
- Skip the chili powder for a milder korma. Alternately add black pepper.
- Don’t overcook the paneer. You may add it directly to the hot gravy.
- Bring seven hundred and twenty ml of water to a rolling boil in a pot. Add onions and cashews to it and boil for 3 mins until the raw smell of the onions has gone. Turn off the stove.
- Remove the onions and cashews with a slotted spoon. Set them aside to cool and later grind it along with green chili to a smooth paste in a grinder jar.
- To the same hot water, add the cauliflower florets and leave them for 1 minute. Later drain the water and rinse them under running water. This blanching is done to get rid of any worms in the florets so you may skip this step if not required. Set aside.
- Heat five ml oil or butter in a pan. Add cashews and almonds. Fry until light golden and then add raisins. As soon as the raisins swell remove all of the nuts and raisins to a small plate.
- To the same pan, add paneer and fry for 2 mins. Do not over fry they turn hard and chewy. If you want soft paneer, Keep them immersed in little warm water until we use later.
- There are 2 ways you can prepare the veggies. The first method is to immerse all the veggies in 1.one thousand two hundred ml of water and boil them until fork tender.
- The other method is to steam them. For this bring four hundred and eighty ml of water to a boil in a steamer. Place the potatoes in a steam basket and stem until half done. Later add the rest of the veggies and steam together until just cooked. Do not over cook them.
- On a low flame, heat oil or butter in a pan. Add cinnamon, cumin, bay leaf, cardamom and cloves to the hot oil.
- When they begin to sizzle Add ginger garlic paste and fry until the raw smell has gone.
- Then add the ground onion cashew paste and cook until it turns thick to a mass and begins to leave the pan, meaning the paste is cooked well.
- Add the ground spices – chili powder, garam masala, turmeric and coriander powder along with salt.
- Saute until oil begins to separate from the mixture.
- Pour three-quarters to two hundred and forty ml water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until slightly thick. Taste test and add more salt if required.
- Add all the steamed veggies and cook covered for 2 mins. Pour cream and stir.
- Add fried paneer and nuts. Turn off the heat and add kewra water or rose water if using. If using pineapple cool down the navratan korma slightly and add the pineapple chunks.
- Garnish navaratan korma with coriander, pomegranate arils and raisins.
- You may skip the cream in the recipe by increasing the quantity of cashews to 18 but it won’t be the same.
- If your cream does not have any stabilizers, it may split if you add it directly to the curry. So temper it first by pouring the cream to a small bowl and then stir in a few tablespoons of gravy with it. Then add back the entire thing to the pan.
- This korma tastes sweetish and a lot of times restaurants don’t add any ground spice that imparts heat to it, like green chilies or red chilli is not added. So it is up to you. You can also simply add some crushed black pepper for the mild heat.

110,Rajma Recipe | Rajma Masala | Rajma Chawal,,"prep_step:
- Restaurant creamy style – Cool down sixty g of cooked rajma masala slightly & add to a small blender along with sixty ml heavy cream/ cooking cream or homemade malai. Blend to a smooth puree and stir back to the prepared hot rajma masala. You may need to adjust the salt at this stage.
- For a special Dhaba style garnish – heat 1seven and one-half ml ghee in a small tadka pan. Add half tsp cumin seeds, 2 dried red chilies, 2 slit green chilies (deseeded), five g (half inch) ginger julienned. Let fry on a low flame until the ginger turns aromatic, for a minute or 2. Turn off and add a large pinch of hing and one and one-quarter g red chili powder (optional). Pour this over the finished Rajma Masala.
- Blanch & puree the onions instead of grating or chopping.
- Puree the tomatoes and use. Chopped or grated tomatoes often separate water in the gravy.
- Blend/mash thirty g of soft cooked rajma with little water and add it to the simmering gravy. Or puree them along with tomatoes & use. This will triple the taste, flavor & texture of your rajma masala. You will be surprised at how good your rajma smells & tastes.
- I haven’t used any cream like they do in the restaurants. However you can add a bit towards the end if you like.
- Add rajma to a large bowl and rinse them thrice. Soak them uncovered in nine hundred and sixty ml water for at least 6 hours to overnight. Discard the water and rinse them well.
- Transfer them to a stovetop pressure cooker or instant pot.  Pour 1one hundred and twenty ml water and pressure cook until soft, for 4 to 5 whistles. Or in the instant pot for 12 to 16 mins, depending on the age of rajma.
- Once cooked they should be soft enough yet hold there shape. If you mash a rajma with your fingers it should get mashed easily.
- Heat ghee or oil in a pot. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf. When they begin to sizzle add the onions and green chili.
- Saute on a medium heat until golden. Stir in the ginger garlic and saute for a minute, until aromatic.
- Pour the tomato puree & cook until the onion tomato mixture turns thick, for about 3 min.
- Stir in the spices – red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder and turmeric. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, until the masala begins to smell aromatic.
- Add the rajma along with the stock (rajma cooked water). Pour more hot water as required (about one-half to two hundred and forty g, only as required) to make a gravy. (If using canned beans, drain the liquid from the can and rinse them before adding).
- Mix well and simmer for 10 to 15 mins, until slightly thick. To make the gravy thick, if you want mash a tbsp of the rajma and add back.
- Taste test and add more salt, one and one-quarter g garam masala if required and crushed kasuri methi. Optionally you may stir in cream and garnish with coriander leaves and ginger juliennes. You can also make a dhaba style tadka garnish or a restaurant style creamy finish from the post.
- Squeeze some lemon juice before serving. Serve rajma with chawal (rice).
- Press Saute button and pour ghee to the steel insert. When the ghee melts, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, chopped onions, green chili and salt.
- Saute for about 5 minutes stirring constantly to cook evenly until golden, about to caramelize but not burnt.
- Add ginger garlic & saute for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
- Add all the spice powders – chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, coriander powder and cumin powder.
- Press cancel. Add rajma and pour four hundred and eighty ml water. Deglaze to release any bits of food stuck at the bottom.
- Place a trivet and keep the bowl of tomato puree over that. Secure the IP with the lid and pressure cook for 18 mins (for softer beans, if you prefer al dente – 16 mins).
- When the pressure drops, open the IP. Rajma should super soft, yet hold shape. Pour the tomato puree and cook for 2 to 3 mins on saute mode. For a thicker consistency, mash some of the rajma. (If required pour about one-half to one hundred and eighty ml water to bring to a runny consistency.)
- Taste test and add more salt, one and one-quarter g garam masala, cream (optional) and crushed kasuri methi. Press cancel.
- Garnish with coriander leaves and ginger juliennes. Serve rajma with chawal. Drizzle some lemon juice.
- Different kinds of rajma have different cook times. I have used dark rajma which takes longer to cook. If you use chitra rajma, pressure cook for just 10 mins in Instant pot.
- Saute the onions well until golden to light brown, about to caramelize. This gives a better flavor and texture to the rajma masala. This helps the onions to dissolve in the gravy & gives a thicker taste.
- You will need around 2one-half to seven hundred and twenty ml water in total. Using lesser water can undercook your onion tomato masala and you won’t get a smoother gravy at the end. You may still adjust the amount of water to your need and taste.
- The amount of water to use changes if you alter the recipe.
- Beans and legumes that are sold since early 2023 are from the fresher stocks and they get cooked faster compared to those sold bet 2020 to 2022. This means you may need to cut down the pressure cooking times to avoid mushy beans.
- If using Canned beans, make the rajma masala on the stovetop and not in the instant pot. Start with two hundred and forty ml hot water to cook the rajma masala. As you cook, add more only if required.

cook_step:
- Restaurant creamy style – Cool down sixty g of cooked rajma masala slightly & add to a small blender along with sixty ml heavy cream/ cooking cream or homemade malai. Blend to a smooth puree and stir back to the prepared hot rajma masala. You may need to adjust the salt at this stage.
- For a special Dhaba style garnish – heat 1seven and one-half ml ghee in a small tadka pan. Add half tsp cumin seeds, 2 dried red chilies, 2 slit green chilies (deseeded), five g (half inch) ginger julienned. Let fry on a low flame until the ginger turns aromatic, for a minute or 2. Turn off and add a large pinch of hing and one and one-quarter g red chili powder (optional). Pour this over the finished Rajma Masala.
- Blanch & puree the onions instead of grating or chopping.
- Puree the tomatoes and use. Chopped or grated tomatoes often separate water in the gravy.
- Blend/mash thirty g of soft cooked rajma with little water and add it to the simmering gravy. Or puree them along with tomatoes & use. This will triple the taste, flavor & texture of your rajma masala. You will be surprised at how good your rajma smells & tastes.
- I haven’t used any cream like they do in the restaurants. However you can add a bit towards the end if you like.
- Add rajma to a large bowl and rinse them thrice. Soak them uncovered in nine hundred and sixty ml water for at least 6 hours to overnight. Discard the water and rinse them well.
- Transfer them to a stovetop pressure cooker or instant pot.  Pour 1one hundred and twenty ml water and pressure cook until soft, for 4 to 5 whistles. Or in the instant pot for 12 to 16 mins, depending on the age of rajma.
- Once cooked they should be soft enough yet hold there shape. If you mash a rajma with your fingers it should get mashed easily.
- Heat ghee or oil in a pot. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf. When they begin to sizzle add the onions and green chili.

116,Dal Makhani Recipe (Restaurant Style),,"prep_step:
- Fine chop 1 small to medium onion to make about one hundred and twenty g chopped (sixty five g)
- Soak black lentils and rajma for at least 8 hours. Well soaked lentils cook up to a creamy texture which is very important to make a delicious dal makhani. To speed up the soaking process, you may soak them in boiling hot water for 4 hours.
- Precook the lentils well before adding them to the makhani masala. Even slightly undercooked dal will not work well here.
- Butter is the key ingredient to make a flavorful dal makhani. Be generous & use a good amount of butter. In India, cultured butter is used which actually brings an amazing flavor. You can also use the regular butter like the way I did. But be generous & add a good amount of it. If you are on a low fat diet, cut down your portion size instead of making a low fat dal makhani.
- I prefer to use half butter and half ghee for cooking the masala as using only butter burns quickly. You may use one for the other.
- Slow cooking lentils on a lowest heat brings out the best flavors. Dal makhani served in restaurants is so much flavorful as the lentils are cooked overnight or whole day on slow fire.
- Without simmering you won’t really get the essential flavors in your dal makhani. I suggest simmering for at least 90 mins after adding the cooked lentils to the tempering or masala.

121,Dal Tadka Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Add dal to a pot or pressure cooker and rinse them very well with lots of water. Rub the lentils well with your hand while you rinse. Drain completely.
- Pour water and pressure cook the dal on a medium heat for 3 to 4 whistles. To cook in instant pot, pressure cook on high for 10 minutes. To cook in pot check my notes below.
- When the pressure drops naturally, open the lid. Dal should be soft cooked.
- Lightly mash keeping some of the dal intact. Add more water only if required to bring to consistency.
- While the lentils cook, to a medium pan pour oil and heat it. Add cumin seeds to the hot oil.
- They will begin to splutter, then add ginger garlic and saute on a low heat until fragrant.
- Add onions and green chilies. Fry them until slightly golden.
- Reduce the heat. Add red chilli powder, turmeric and garam masala. Give a quick stir.
- Stir in the tomatoes along with salt. Saute until the tomatoes become soft. The mixture begins to smell good at this stage.
- Transfer this to the cooked dal and simmer for about 6 to 7 minutes. Taste test and add more salt at this stage. Then add kasuri methi and give the boiling dal a good stir. Add coriander leaves and turn off the heat.
- Place a tall steel cup in the center of the pot. With a tong hold a wood coal over direct fire like a candle or lighter until a portion of it becomes red and hot. This will take about 2 minutes.
- Place this gently into the cup and pour two and one-half ml ghee directly over the hot coal. It will begin to release smoke. Quickly cover the pot and let the dal smoke for 3 to 4 minutes.
- Transfer the hot cooked lentils to a serving bowl. Pour 2 tbsps ghee to a small pan & heat it on a medium heat.
- Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds (optional). Let them fry & splutter on a low heat until aromatic.
- Next add red chilies and give a good stir. Add garlic and curry leaves (optional). Fry until light and aromatic. Do not brown.
- Stir in asafoetida and red chili powder. Quickly remove from heat and pour the tadka over the dal.
- Garnish dal tadka with coriander leaves. Squeeze some lemon juice over the dal while serving. Serve with Basmati rice , roti, paratha, naan, jeera rice or ghee rice.
- For two hundred and forty g dal mentioned in the recipe I use one hundred and eighty g toor dal (split pigeon peas), sixty g moong dal (or red lentils/ masoor) & thirty g chana dal (bengal gram). If you want you may just use two hundred and forty g toor dal. This combination is what makes this dal tadka so much special in flavor, texture and taste.
- Water: If using only toor dal, you will require lesser water to add at the later stage i.e while cooking with onion tomato masala.
- To cook in a pot , simply soak the lentils in seven hundred and twenty ml hot water for at least 30 minutes. Let it come to a boil over high heat. Then simmer for 20-30 minutes. If required add more hot water. Remove any scum that forms on top of the dal and discard it. Turn off the heat when they are soft and mushy. Follow the rest of the recipe.
- To cook in a Instant Pot , you may simply make the onion tomato masala first in the steel insert and add the lentils. Pressure cook for 10 mins. When the pressure drops, make a separate tadka in a small pan and add it.
- Amchur- If you want you may stir in amchur along with kasuri methi.

- For the simplest version, saute fine chopped onions until deep golden, then ginger garlic and then add pureed tomatoes & cashews. Saute until thick and add spices. Pour water and make a thick gravy. Add matar and paneer to this.
- To add yogurt & skip cream, you can follow my restaurant dum aloo recipe . Just skip the aloo and use matar and paneer instead with the amount of water mentioned in this post. I also have instant pot version in that post.
- To make matar paneer without onions and garlic, you can follow my paneer makhani recipe .
- Pour oil to a hot pan and add green cardamoms (optional), ginger & garlic. Saute for a minute and add onions.
- Saute until light golden for 5 to 6 mins. Add tomatoes, cashews and salt. Saute for 2 to 3 mins and cook covered until mushy and soft. If the pan dries out, add a splash of water while you cook.
- Cool this and transfer to a blender. Add the optional ingredient – yogurt or tomato paste and blend to a smooth puree.
- Heat ghee or oil in the same pan. Add cinnamon & bay leaf, let sizzle in oil for a minute.
- Lower the heat completely and stir in turmeric, chili powder, garam masala and coriander powder. Transfer the pureed onion tomato masala. (If your puree isn't smooth, turn off the heat and pass it through a strainer, directly to the pan)
- Saute for 2 to 3 mins until the masala comes together and turns thick. Stir in the rinsed green peas and water to make a gravy.
- Bring to a boil and cook partially covered on a medium heat, until the gravy turns thick and traces of fat are visible on the gravy. This takes me about 10 to 12 mins.
- Optionally fry paneer – Spread and heat seven and one-half ml ghee in a non-stick pan and place the diced paneer. Fry on a medium high heat until golden, for 3 mins. Turn them to the other side with a tong and repeat the process.
- Crush kasuri methi in your palm and add it. Add slit deseeded green chili, sugar (both optional) and paneer. Mix and taste test to adjust salt and garam masala.
- Cook for 2 mins for the paneer to heat through and turn off.  Stir in the heavy cream and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve matar paneer with Basmati rice , jeera rice , naan or paratha.
- Press saute button on the instant pot and pour fifteen ml oil. Sauté onions, ginger and garlic for 5 mins. Press cancel. (Or Alternately bring 1one hundred and twenty ml water to a rolling boil and add the onions. Boil for 5 mins and remove them.)
- To a blender jar, add the sauteed/boiled onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, cashews, cardamoms and yogurt (optional). Blend to a very smooth puree.
- Press saute button on the instant pot and pour ghee/oil. Add bay leaf, cinnamon and transfer the onion tomato puree. Stir in the red chilli powder, turmeric, salt, sugar, coriander powder and garam masala.
- Saute until the mixture turns slightly thicker and aromatic. Cover with an external lid to avoid splatters. This step takes about 5 minutes. Press cancel button.

- To make 2x use only 2 cardamoms, for 3x- 3 cardamoms. Using too many cardamoms can impart overpowering flavors.
- For a nut-free option , omit cashews and use one-third to one hundred and twenty ml heavy cream at the finishing stage. Cut down the amount of water for the sauce, use only one hundred and eighty g.
- Cashews can be substituted with soaked almonds or almond flour or nut butter.

156,Palak Corn (Spinach Corn Curry),,"prep_step:
- For extra flavor, saute onions and tomatoes for longer (until mushy) instead of boiling them with water. Saute spinach as well. This is highly recommended if you double or triple the recipe. For our everyday food, I prefer not to saute in oil for too long. So I boil them with water. Also sauteing will require a little more oil.
- If you are using besan, roast it very well until aromatic and add them to the sauteed onions. We are not sautéing the onions until golden in this recipe, so it is important to roast the flour separately.
- Avoid making the dish too hot. That will mute the flavors of the spinach and cashews.
- There is no advantage of making this dish in IP, except you can cook the basmati rice while cooking the onions and tomatoes. If you are using premium aged basmati rice that takes longer than 5 mins to cook in IP, you may cook longer or soak the rice for 30 mins and cook for the same 5 mins.
- Lemon juice as required to serve
- Heat oil in a pot and add the cardamoms, onions, green chilies, ginger, garlic, and salt. Saute for 4 to 5 mins until transparent. Add the cashews, tomatoes and water. Bring to a rolling boil on a high heat. Reduce to medium and cook covered until very soft, for 10 mins.
- Open the lid & reserve half of the green chilies aside so you can adjust the heat levels as you blend in the next steps.
- Stir in garam masala, salt, spinach and coriander leaves. Saute until wilted and cooked through, for 3 to 4 mins. Turn off and stir in the rest of the water.
- Blend using an immersion blender or a stand blender to a smooth or coarse puree, as per your preference. (cool down first, if using a stand blender). Taste test and adjust the green chilies/heat level at this stage.
- Return the palak mixture to the pot and add corn kernels. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 3 to 4 mins. If you are using mature spinach, you may cook for another 3 to 4 mins. Taste test and adjust salt & garam masala. Crush kasuri methi in your hands and sprinkle.
- Turn off and pour the cream. Corn palak is ready to serve at this stage. You may serve it with a squeeze of lemon juice if you don't want to make the tadka.
- Heat five ml ghee in a non-stick pan and place the paneer cubes. Fry until golden on a medium high heat, tossing them around gently. Stir in half to the corn palak and reserve the rest.
- Turn off the heat and add the remaining ghee, cumin seeds and red chilies. When the seeds sizzle, turn on and add the garlic.
- Let fry on a low heat until light golden. Turn off and stir in the hing, red chili powder and the rest of the fried paneer. Mix well and pour this immediately over the corn palak. Garnish with more heavy cream if you want.
- Perform the first step on saute mode and pressure cook for 5 mins after pouring water. I cook basmati rice along with this, placed on a high legged trivet. Gently release the pressure immediately. Follow the rest as mentioned above.
- Nutrition values include paneer, heavy cream, cashews and all other optional ingredients.
- If you any more sides, this can serve 6 people.
- Avoid mature coriander leaves and stalks as it can make your dish taste soapy.
- To use yogurt, whisk it well in a bowl and stir in 2 to forty five g of cooked corn palak. Mix well and add back to the pot. Avoid cooking after adding yogurt. Also omit tomatoes if you are using yogurt.

166,Malai Kofta Recipe (Paneer Kofta),,"prep_step:
- Then immediately pour the tomato onion puree. Be careful and do not burn the spices. You can also do the other way like I did poured the puree first and then added the ground spices.
- If your homemade paneer is too wet with whey, grate it, spread on a tray and leave it uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. Excess moisture will be dried out.
- You can make stuffed kofta with chopped raisins and cashews. In restaurants, fine chopped cashews, raisins and mawa is mixed and stuffed inside the koftas. I prefer to add the nuts and raisins to the kofta mixture instead, for ease of making.
- If you don’t like to saute your onions in oil, simply dry saute for 3 to 4 mins and then continue with the recipe. Though the flavor is different while you saute, the end result is delicious and tastes the same.
- You can substitute ginger garlic paste with chopped/sliced ginger and garlic. Add it when you saute the onions.
- Heat fifteen ml oil in a pan. When the oil turns hot, add cardamoms, cloves & cinnamon.
- Then add onions and saute until they turn transparent or golden.
- Next add tomatoes & cashews. Saute for 2 to 3 mins. Pour half cup water & boil all the ingredients until soft & mushy.
- Turn off the stove and cool completely. Add to a blender jar, retain all the whole spices we used. Don't discard them. Blend this to a smooth puree. Strain the puree (filter) through a strainer to another bowl.
- Heat a pan with oil or butter. Add bay leaf, cinnamon and cardamoms (all spices are optional here). Saute for a minute.
- Add ginger garlic paste and saute on a low heat till the raw smell goes away. This takes about 2 to 3 mins.
- Quickly stir in chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder,salt and sugar. Pour the onion tomato puree. Mix it well.
- Saute for 3 to 4 mins for the raw smell of chili powder to go away.
- Pour one-half to one hundred and eighty ml water to make a gravy. Cook covered until the gravy thickens and traces of oil are seen on top. The raw smell of the ingredients should have gone.
- Add kasuri methi and taste test. If needed add more salt.
- Regulate the flame to low and add cream. Stir and turn off the heat. Set this aside.
- To make malai kofta, boil potatoes just until fork tender and not mushy.
- Crumble them and add to a mixing bowl along with crumbled paneer, ginger paste, corn flour, salt, garam masala and chopped coriander leaves.
- Also add raisins and cashews. Or you can stuff them in the koftas.
- Mix everything well and divide the dough to 8 equal parts. Roll them to balls.
- If you prefer, you can also flatten each ball. Place the cashews and raisins in the center and seal.
- Heat oil in a kadai for deep frying. Check if the oil is hot enough by sliding in a small portion of the malai kofta mixture.
- It has to rise without browning a lot. This is the right temperature.
- Test the dough : Wait for the oil to heat up. Pinch off five g of the kofta mixture and roll to a small ball. Slide it to the hot oil to ensure the mixture is right and does not disintegrate.
- If the ball does not disintegrate or disperse in oil, then go ahead with the next step. If the ball disintegrates, add more corn starch to fix it (refer notes).
- Slide the koftas one by one gently to the hot oil.
- Deep fry on a medium flame until crisp and golden. Remove them to a steel colander or plate.
- Cool the gravy completelt and transfer it to a serving dish.
- Cool the malai koftas slightly. Place them in the gravy and pour fifteen ml of cream. (avoid adding hot koftas to hot gravy)
- Garnish malai kofta with coriander leaves & serve with butter naan or Jeera Rice .
- Mushy potatoes are not suitable to make malai kofta. Too much moisture in your potatoes will disintegrate your koftas. Cook the potatoes just until fork tender.
- If you add the kofta balls to oil that is not hot enough, the balls will disperse in the oil. So ensure the oil is hot enough before you fry the first ball.
- Paneer: You can use store bought paneer or homemade. If using homemade make sure it is completely dry and not soggy. You don’t need to set the paneer after straining and hanging it. I usually put the whole pack of hung paneer uncovered (along with the muslin/ cheese cloth) in the fridge, overnight. By the next day most of the moisture would have gone and it turns out perfect. To substitute paneer, use extra firm tofu. You may need to add more corn starch if your kofta mixture is sticky.
- Potatoes: Make sure you boil the potatoes only until fork tender and not mushy or too soft. Overcooked potatoes retain excess moisture & that’s not good for koftas. If your potatoes are mushy with lots of moisture you may use more corn starch but that can alter the texture of your koftas. So make sure they are boiled whole just until fork tender.
- Corn Starch: Corn starch is the same as white corn flour. It helps the kofta ingredients bind together. Arrow root powder or tapioca flour works well too but make sure you use only little oil to fry them.
- Cashews: Cashews are used in both kofta balls and even in the curry. They add richness, creaminess and milky aroma to the curry. I have used cashews to cut down the amount of cream and that also helps to cut down the calories and makes for a healthier and lighter dish.
- To substitute cashews, you may use cashew meal, almond meal, cashew or almond butter. For a nut-free option, use sunflower seeds, white poppy seeds or magaz seeds (melon seeds).
- Cream: If you want you may skip the cream from the gravy but without cream/malai the dish won’t be malai kofta. But you can still make it equally creamy with the addition of more cashews.

If your potatoes are mushy with lots of moisture you may use more corn starch but that can alter the texture of your koftas. So make sure they are boiled whole just until fork tender.
- Corn Starch: Corn starch is the same as white corn flour. It helps the kofta ingredients bind together. Arrow root powder or tapioca flour works well too but make sure you use only little oil to fry them.
- Cashews: Cashews are used in both kofta balls and even in the curry. They add richness, creaminess and milky aroma to the curry. I have used cashews to cut down the amount of cream and that also helps to cut down the calories and makes for a healthier and lighter dish.
- To substitute cashews, you may use cashew meal, almond meal, cashew or almond butter. For a nut-free option, use sunflower seeds, white poppy seeds or magaz seeds (melon seeds).
- Cream: If you want you may skip the cream from the gravy but without cream/malai the dish won’t be malai kofta. But you can still make it equally creamy with the addition of more cashews.",20,30,50,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

216,Paneer Biryani Recipe (Easy Dum Method),,"prep_step:
- Rice: For any biryani recipe, I usually prefer aged basmati rice as the grains become fluffy, tender and non-sticky when cooked. Parboiled basmati rice (sella basmati rice) is another variety I like to use. You can make this biryani with any long-grained, non-sticky rice.
- Cooking rice: Do not cook the rice completely, should be slightly underdone. Fully cooked grains will end up in a mushy biryani since the rice cooks further during the dum-cooking process.
- Paneer: Use homemade paneer for best taste and texture. For frozen paneer, thaw in warm or hot water for some minutes.
- Marinating paneer: I always marinate paneer for 30 minutes at room temperature. If I have more time, I marinate overnight in the refrigerator.
- Adding vegetables: You can add some steamed green peas and steamed veggies like carrots, cauliflower, potatoes to this recipe. But you will have to increase the curd and other spices accordingly to accommodate them.
- Making birista: The fried onions (birista) can be made a day before and stored in an air-tight container. You can also make a big batch and freeze for a longer storage and use.
- Whole spices: I recommend adding all the spices and herbs in the same proportion as listed in the recipe. The only suggestion I offer, which will alter the flavor slightly, is to replace caraway seeds (shahi jeera) with cumin seeds.
- Nuts and dried fruits: Fried cashews and raisins can be added on top of the rice layers.
- Vegan option: For a vegan biryani, use tofu, oil and a dairy free curd and milk like cashew or almond milk/curd. Avoid soy or peanut yogurt, as it gives an after taste.
- Rinse basmati rice very well in water till the starch clears from the water. The water should be clear and not cloudy or opaque.
- Then soak the rice in water for 30 minutes. Later drain the rice well and keep aside.
- Bring nine hundred and sixty ml water to a rolling boil in a pot.
- Add whole spices – cinnamon, tej patta, cloves , green cardamoms, caraway seeds. Also add salt.
- Now add the soaked rice. Do not stir the rice.
- Keep the flame to high and cook the rice without lowering the temperature.
- The rice grains have to be cooked till 75% or three-quarters done. They should have a bite to them when eaten.
- Drain the rice in a colander. You can also rinse the rice grains to remove starch if any and to stop the grains from cooking. Cover with a lid and keep the rice aside.
- When the rice is soaking, prep the ingredients for the biryani. Slice the onions. Heat the oil or ghee in a small frying pan and add the sliced onions.
- Stir and begin to fry the onions till they turn golden. Add one or two pinches of salt for quick browning of the onions. Stir often for uniform browning and fry on a low flame.
- Here the onions have begun to get golden.
- Once the onions become golden, then remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on kitchen paper towels. Keep the fried onions aside.
- Warm the milk on stove top or in the microwave. Add 16 to 18 saffron strands to the milk. Stir and keep aside.
- Whisk full fat curd (yogurt) in a mixing bowl till smooth.
- Add ginger paste, garlic paste, chopped green chilies, chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves. Mix well.
- Now add the spices- turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, caraway seeds and lemon juice.
- And salt as required. Mix again.
- Then add the half of the fried onions and the paneer cubes.
- Mix gently. Cover and keep the marinated paneer aside for 30 minutes.
- Add the same oil in which we fried the onions to a pan or pot.
- Add the marinated paneer and layer neatly.
- Make a rice layer now. Add all the rice. I have just made two layers. If you want you can make four layers.
- Add the remaining fried onions, chopped coriander and mint leaves.
- Sprinkle the saffron infused milk.
- Dot with ghee. You can also add rose water or kewra water.
- Cover with a aluminium foil or with a moist kitchen cotton towel or napkin.
- Place the lid tightly on the pan and place it on a tava or griddle. For the first 5 minutes dum cook the biryani on a medium heat.
- Then lower the flame and cook the biryani.
- On dum for 12 to 15 minutes. You can also cook the biryani in a preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). Use an oven proof pot or pan.
- Serve the Paneer Biryani hot with boondi raita or cucumber raita or onion raita or kuchumber salad.
- Enjoy Paneer Biryani hot or warm with raita like an onion-tomato raita or cucumber raita or boondi raita. You can also serve with sliced onion-lime salad or onion-tomato-cucumber salad.
- Pairing it with curries like mirchi ka salan and bagara baingan also tastes awesome. Even a simple plain yogurt tastes nice with it.
- Place any leftovers in any sealed box or container and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days. Reheat by warming in the oven at 90 degrees Celsius (190 degrees Fahrenheit) or by steaming in the Instant pot for 5 minutes.

256,Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Cube chicken to 1 to 1one-half inch pieces. Add them to a mixing bowl. Make sure there is no excess moisture in your chicken. If you want you may pat dry with a few kitchen tissues.
- Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, salt, lemon juice, oil, ginger garlic paste, yogurt and kasuri methi. Skip the lemon juice if your yogurt is sour.
- Mix well. Cover with a cling wrap and refrigerate for minimum of 8 hours and up to 48 hours. If you are in a rush, you may cut down to 3 hours.
- Heat oil or ghee in a pot or pan. Add onions and sprinkle five g salt. Saute until deep golden.
- Add ginger garlic paste and green chilli. Saute until aromatic, for 40 to 60 seconds.
- Reduce the heat to low. Add red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala and cumin powder. Stir well quickly.
- Add the tomatoes and cook on a medium high heat until the onion tomato masala becomes really thick. (If using fresh tomatoes, it takes about 7 to 8 mins and tomato puree/passata takes only 2 minutes)
- Pour hot water and mix well. Bring to a rolling boil and cover. Simmer until thick, for about 12 to 14 mins.
- Optional – Cool down and blend to a smooth puree. Return it to the pot and heat up. This step cuts down the acidity from canned tomatoes.
- Grill in Oven : While the gravy simmers, thread the chicken to the metal skewers or soaked bamboo skewers and place them in a prepared tray. Bake them in a preheated oven at 460 F or 240 C for 9 to 10 mins. Turn them to the other side with a tong and grill then for another 9 to 10 mins. To char the chicken, broil for 2 to 3 mins or until slightly charred.
- Or In a Skillet: Pour fifteen ml oil to a skillet and heat it well. Place the chicken tikka one by one, spacing them apart. Cook on a medium high heat for 3 mins, turn them to the other side with a tong and cook for another 3 mins, until charred and   not essentially fully cooked. Remove to a plate and Cook in batches.
- Or In the Air fryer: Thread on skewers and place them in the basket or in the tray. Air fry for 6 mins, at 400 F or 200 C. Turn them with tongs and air fry for another 6 mins. If they dry out, you may baste with marinade and continue for another 2 mins, until slightly charred.
- After 12 to 14 mins of simmering the tikka masala sauce, add sugar and the cream (or cashew cream, check notes to make your own). Stir well and cook for a few minutes until thick, creamy and aromatic. (Check video for consistency)
- Add the grilled chicken tikka and crushed kasuri methi. (Make sure your gravy has reached a thick gravy consistency/serving consistency, before adding chicken). Stir and cook for 2 to 3 mins until chicken tikka is soft and tender. Taste test and add more salt, garam masala and sugar if needed.
- Turn off and garnish with cream and coriander leaves. Serve chicken tikka masala with Butter Naan, roti, paratha, Basmati rice or Jeera rice.
- You can start with chopped tomatoes if you intend to puree the sauce/gravy.
- Avoid using Canned tomatoes with citric acid added to it.
- Avoid using sour yogurt. If it is even slightly sour, avoid using lemon juice.
- To make the cashew cream, powder cashews finely in a grinder jar and pour seventy nine and 0.2 ml water to it. Grind to a smooth thick creamy paste. You will get half cup cashew cream. Later pour 3 tbsps water and swirl the jar and pour that as well to the gravy. If you do not have a powerful grinder, you may soak the cashews in seventy nine and 0.2 ml hot water for 15 mins, grind them with the same water to a smooth puree. I have tried and both work equally well.
- If cooking tikkas on the pan, they don’t need to be fully cooked but must be almost there. If you try to fully cook, they may dry out, turn hard and chewy.
- To make this authentic Indian, add 1 bay leaf, 3 to 4 cardamoms, cloves, 2 inch cinnamon to the hot oil before sautéing the onions. Also add bell peppers and onions to the marinade before grilling them. Use mustard oil for the tikkas.
- Make this ahead by splitting the recipe. Marinate chicken the previous night. Also make the gravy till the tikka sauce the previous day. The next day grill the tikkas and heat the gravy, add the cream and simmer. Later add the tikkas.
- To mimic the smoky flavor of the Tandoor, you may smoke your chicken tikka masala. For that, Place a small piece of foil or a tall steel cup on the finished chicken tikka masala. Hold 1 to 2 inch piece of natural wood charcoal with a tong and burn it on direct fire until red hot. Later place it on the foil kept over the curry or in the steel cup. Quickly pour one and one-quarter ml ghee on the hot coal. Immediately cover the pot and smoke for 4 to 5 mins. For stronger flavor, add another one and one-quarter ml ghee on the coal and repeat the smoking. If you overdo this, it will have very strong smoky flavors, so be cautious. You may check my Dal Makhani video to see how I actually do it.
- To make more servings , start with four hundred and eighty ml of water if using cashews, (or two hundred and forty ml water if using only heavy cream). As you cook, add half cup more at a time only if required (for 2x & 3x). Taste test the gravy after cooking, onions should be tender and soft but not crunchy or partially cooked. If they are undercooked, pour more hot water and simmer until well cooked.
- For 2x and 3x, double and triple the quantity of cashews and water for cashew cream. Cashews have a thickening property, if you reduce the quantity of water your curry won’t turn thick.

Keep this aside. one-half to fifteen g garlic paste, ten g Kashmiri red chili powder, two and one-half g sugar, five ml lemon juice or vinegar (optional, or sixty ml thick yogurt), thirty ml water (leave out if using yogurt to temper)
- On a medium flame, heat oi in a heavy bottom deep pan for frying. While the oil heats up, add cornstarch, rice flour and egg white to the marinated chicken.
- Mix well to coat the chicken well with flour and eggs or yogurt. The coating should be moist and not runny or too dry. If it is too dry, you may splash some water and mix well.
- Test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a pinch of batter in the hot oil. It must come up immediately without becoming brown. If it sinks and remains there, it means the oil is not hot enough yet.
- When the oil is hot enough, gently drop the chicken pieces into the oil. Do not crowd the pan.
- Do not disturb the chicken pieces for 2 minutes. Stir and let them cook on a medium heat until crisp and golden. Reduce the heat slightly and let them fry the last 1 minute until deep golden & really crisp.
- Remove them to a steel colander and continue to fry them in batches.
- Once you are done with the chicken, reduce the flame to lowest and place 2 sprigs of curry leaves on a skimmer or strainer ladle and gently lower to the hot oil. Fry the curry leaves until crisp. Remove to the colander.
- Place your slit and deseeded green chilies on the strainer ladle and lower it to the hot oil. Fry them until blistered. Turn off the heat. Toss all of these and serve this Chennai style Chicken 65 immediately or go ahead with the tempering below.
- To Bake in the oven, preheat the oven to 200 C or 390 F for at least 15 mins. Place the chicken pieces on a tray lined with parchment paper or foil. Bake for 35 to 40 mins, flipping after 20 mins. When the chicken is almost done, Place the curry leaves and slit green chilies. Broil for 2 mins. Adjust the baking time as every oven is different.
- Place the chicken on an air fryer parchment paper (perforated parchment paper). Air fry at 375 F or 180 C for 8 minutes, flip them and air fry for another 3 to 4 mins depending on how dry or crispy you want it. Place the sprig of curry leaves and slit green chilies and air fry for 2 more mins. Adjust the timings a bit as every air fryer is different.
- Pour thirty ml oil to wok. You can use fresh oil or use the same fried chicken oil. When the oil turns hot, add chopped garlic, 5 to 6 curry leaves and 2 slit green chilies. Stir fry until the curry leaves turn crisp, do not brown the garlic.
- Slide the curry leaves and the chilies to a side in the wok. Lower the heat completely and pour the chilli garlic paste, thirty ml water and salt. Mix well and let it cook on a medium heat until all of the water evaporates.

- If using yogurt to temper, begin to cook at a low heat after adding the chilli garlic paste. We don’t want the yogurt to split.
- To make it kids’ friendly simply skip the tempering for the kids portion. You can also reduce the red chilli powder from the marinade.
- You may use bone-in chicken or boneless chicken thighs or breasts. If using bone-in chicken or breasts, it is essential to rest the marinated chicken for a minimum of 4 to 6 hours else they will dry out and turn chewy.
- Egg white can be replaced with curd.
- The proportion of yogurt, egg and flour is very important. If you alter this, the coating from the chicken may fall off.
- If using a strong garam masala, use it in combination with other spices like cumin and coriander. The coating may taste bitter if you add a lot of garam masala or red chilli powder.
- Sugar in the tempering cuts down the pungent flavor from garlic. It also helps to keep the chicken crisp after tempering. Vinegar or lemon juice also cuts down the pungent flavor from garlic.
- Chili Garlic paste:  My family loves this with fifteen g garlic paste in the chilli garlic paste, you may cut down if you don’t prefer pungent taste or flavor.

- Once you are done with the chicken, reduce the flame to lowest and place 2 sprigs of curry leaves on a skimmer or strainer ladle and gently lower to the hot oil. Fry the curry leaves until crisp. Remove to the colander.
- Place your slit and deseeded green chilies on the strainer ladle and lower it to the hot oil. Fry them until blistered. Turn off the heat. Toss all of these and serve this Chennai style Chicken 65 immediately or go ahead with the tempering below.
- To Bake in the oven, preheat the oven to 200 C or 390 F for at least 15 mins. Place the chicken pieces on a tray lined with parchment paper or foil. Bake for 35 to 40 mins, flipping after 20 mins. When the chicken is almost done, Place the curry leaves and slit green chilies. Broil for 2 mins. Adjust the baking time as every oven is different.
- Place the chicken on an air fryer parchment paper (perforated parchment paper). Air fry at 375 F or 180 C for 8 minutes, flip them and air fry for another 3 to 4 mins depending on how dry or crispy you want it. Place the sprig of curry leaves and slit green chilies and air fry for 2 more mins. Adjust the timings a bit as every air fryer is different.
- Pour thirty ml oil to wok. You can use fresh oil or use the same fried chicken oil. When the oil turns hot, add chopped garlic, 5 to 6 curry leaves and 2 slit green chilies. Stir fry until the curry leaves turn crisp, do not brown the garlic.
- Slide the curry leaves and the chilies to a side in the wok. Lower the heat completely and pour the chilli garlic paste, thirty ml water and salt. Mix well and let it cook on a medium heat until all of the water evaporates.
- Taste test the fried chicken and the sauce too. Adjust your sauce to your liking, by adding more salt or red chilli to your taste.
- Once it is done, you should have a thick oily chilli sauce in the wok. Add the fried chicken (set aside the previously deep fried curry leaves and green chilies for garnish).
- Turn off and Toss well to coat the chicken with the tempering. Garnish chicken 65 with crunchy curry leaves and green chilies. Squeeze some lemon juice and serve with fresh cut raw onions.
- Please note you have to 2x & 3x the substitutes mentioned in the brackets if you are trying to make 2x & 3x.
- If using yogurt to temper, begin to cook at a low heat after adding the chilli garlic paste. We don’t want the yogurt to split.
- To make it kids’ friendly simply skip the tempering for the kids portion. You can also reduce the red chilli powder from the marinade.
- You may use bone-in chicken or boneless chicken thighs or breasts. If using bone-in chicken or breasts, it is essential to rest the marinated chicken for a minimum of 4 to 6 hours else they will dry out and turn chewy.
- Egg white can be replaced with curd.
- The proportion of yogurt, egg and flour is very important. If you alter this, the coating from the chicken may fall off.
- If using a strong garam masala, use it in combination with other spices like cumin and coriander. The coating may taste bitter if you add a lot of garam masala or red chilli powder.
- Sugar in the tempering cuts down the pungent flavor from garlic. It also helps to keep the chicken crisp after tempering. Vinegar or lemon juice also cuts down the pungent flavor from garlic.
- Chili Garlic paste:  My family loves this with fifteen g garlic paste in the chilli garlic paste, you may cut down if you don’t prefer pungent taste or flavor.",20,30,50,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

265,Chicken Curry Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Fine chop the onions so they cook down to a jammy texture in the curry. This also helps to cook the onions faster. You may use a chopper or food processor for that.
- You can use chopped tomatoes or pureed tomatoes. I prefer to peel and deseed the tomatoes if using them in chopped form. If you want to use canned tomatoes or passata, you will need higher amount of ground spices.
- The specialty of this chicken curry is to slow cook on a low heat. Do not hurry up to finish the dish. A slow cooked dish is worth the effort as it really stands out in taste & flavor. A chicken curry prepared on a high heat yields a hotchpotch curry and not the one that you will really love & enjoy.
- On a medium flame, heat oil in a deep pan.  Add the whole spices – bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves & green cardamoms.
- Stir in the chopped onions and chilies. Saute until deep golden in color, for 7 to 8 mins.
- Add ginger garlic paste and saute till you get a nice aroma, for about a minute.
- Then add tomatoes, turmeric and salt. Mix well and cook until the tomatoes turn soft & mushy.
- Turn down the heat to low, Stir in the yogurt (or cashew paste), red chili powder, garam masala & coriander powder.
- Cook on low heat, until the mixture smells good and aromatic.
- Add chicken and coriander leaves. Fry on a medium heat till the chicken turns white or pale in color. This takes around 3 mins.
- Cover and cook on a low heat for 3 to 4 minutes. This step is very important as the chicken absorbs all the flavors of the spices.
- Meanwhile in a separate pot, heat up two hundred and forty ml water. Using cold water most times toughens the chicken so it is good to use hot water.
- Pour hot water just enough (about one hundred and twenty g) to make a thick gravy. As you cook, chicken lets out plenty of moisture, depending on that add more water. Check the pictures in the post for consistency.
- Cover and cook on a medium flame till the chicken is soft cooked and the curry/gravy turns thick. When the chicken is cooked completely it will fall off the bone easily.
- Taste the curry & add more salt if needed. You can also add another two and one-half g garam masala at this stage if you feel it is less in flavors.
- Lastly garnish with coriander leaves, cover and off the heat. Serve chicken curry with butter naan or jeera rice .
- You leave out the whole spices if you do not have. But they add a more intense flavor to the curry.
- To prevent yogurt from splitting, add it to a bowl and whisk it well with a fork. Add 2 tbsps of onion tomato masala (made in the recipe) and mix it well with yogurt. Then lower the flame completely and pour the yogurt to the pan.
- To substitute yogurt, use 1.5 tbsps cashew butter or soak 12 cashew nuts or almonds or forty five g of white poppy seeds in half cup water for 30 minutes. Later blend it with 4 to ninety ml water in a small grinder to make super smooth milk.
- If you don’t like chunky curry with onions and tomatoes then blend the onion tomato masala with half cup water in a blender.
- Adding cold water to chicken sometimes makes it hard or tough. So use hot water.
- This chicken curry can be cooked in coconut milk instead of water. Do not pour cold coconut milk. Heat up and add.
- Please choose a good garam masala for the recipe especially if using store bought. Some brands sell really pungent garam masala. Use it with caution.
- You can also use 3 to 4 tbsps of cream or thick coconut milk towards the end if you prefer. Just add it towards the end and turn off.

267,Masala Chai Recipe (Authentic Indian Spiced Milk Tea),,"prep_step:
- Milk: The amount of milk added varies from person to person. So you can add milk as per your preference.
- Tea type: The type of tea also makes a difference to the overall flavor. I always use Assam tea as it is stronger than Darjeeling tea. But I do know some folks who prefer a mix of Assam + Darjeeling tea or only Darjeeling tea. What I have used here is organic Assam tea which is not the same as tea leaves, but in granules. You may use either one.
- Spices: You may adjust the quantity of spices as required. I would suggest reducing the quantity of spice in the summertime as spices increase body heat and sweating. Increasing the quantity of spice may help to keep the body warm during winter or also when you have cold.
- Making tea: The classic way of making tea is to steep the tea leaves in hot water. The Indian method is boiling the tea leaves for some minutes. I usually add milk later. Though in some families, water, milk and tea leaves are boiled together.
- Strong tea: This recipe is a strong tea due to the taste and aroma of Assam tea along with the flavor of the spices. Adjust the amount of ginger to suit your taste.
- Adrak Chai (Ginger Tea) – Spiced Indian tea brewed with fresh ginger, milk, and black tea for a warm, soothing flavor; especially comforting in cold weather.
- Cutting Chai – Mumbai’s iconic half-glass chai, strong and brisk, often served at roadside stalls in small glasses with a punchy flavor.

268,Irani Chai Recipe (Cafe Style Irani Tea),,"prep_step:
- Tea Decoction : Strong black tea is simmered for a long time with spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon in water. This creates a bold, intense tea concentrate.
- Milk Base : Separately, whole milk is simmered slowly with sugar until it becomes slightly thick and creamy.
- Use full-fat milk: To achieve the signature richness Irani Chai is known for, full-fat milk is non-negotiable. Toned or skim milk just won’t give you the velvety body this chai demands. The creamier, the better.
- Go for strong Assam CTC tea: For that bold, malty depth and the beautiful reddish-brown hue, choose robust Assam CTC (Crush-Tear-Curl) tea. It holds up well to the long simmer and cuts through the creaminess. Skip light-bodied teas like Darjeeling or any flavored blends as they lack the punch needed here.
- Slow-reduce the milk: Let the milk gently simmer on low heat until it reduces by about 20 to 25%. This slow evaporation intensifies the creaminess and gives the tea its signature creamy texture.
- Brew the decoction separately: Steep the tea leaves in water with a touch of cardamom, and optionally, clove or cinnamon for a whisper of warmth. Avoid boiling the tea leaves directly in milk as it muddies the flavor and compromises clarity.
- Adjust sweetness: The sweetness of Irani Tea can vary from mildly sweet to decadently sugary, depending on your preference. Traditionally, a generous amount of sugar is added to the milk while it simmers, which balances the strong decoction beautifully.
- Alternative sweeteners: Jaggery or unrefined cane sugar can offer a more earthy sweetness, though they may slightly alter the color.
- Strain for a smooth sip: Straining both the decoction and the milk (especially if it’s developed a layer of malai) ensures a clean, silky finish.
- Combine just before serving: Pour the tea decoction into the reduced milk, not the other way around. This allows you to control the balance of strength and creaminess with each cup.
- Optional aromatics: For a luxurious touch, stir in two to three drops of rose water or kewra essence just before serving – an homage to the old Irani cafés where aroma was as important as taste.
- Vegan Options: For a vegan version, try almond or cashew milk, but simmer gently as they thicken differently than dairy.
- In a saucepan, heat full-fat milk or whole milk.
- Bring it to a boil and simmer on low to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
- Let the milk reduce by about one-quarter over low to medium-low heat. This process takes around 15 to 20 minutes in total and makes the milk richer and slightly thicker, enhancing the creaminess of the chai.
- You'll know the milk is reduced when the volume is down to 1.one thousand two hundred g and the milk will look slightly creamier and richer in color.
- Once the milk has reduced and thickened, add sugar to it and stir to dissolve.
- Optional: Add a few drops of rose water or kewra water at the end for a floral aroma.
- Take the spices – cardamom, cloves and cinnamon in a mortar. Crush these lightly with a pestle.
- Meanwhile when the milk is simmering, in another saucepan, take water and the crushed spices.
- Bring this water added with the spices to a boil.
- Add black tea and simmer on low heat for about 3 to 5 minutes or until the water has a nice amber color. Opt to strain and keep the tea decoction hot in a flask if you prefer.
- Once the tea decoction is ready, turn off the heat of the stovetop where the milk is simmering. Lift the saucepan and pour about one-third to one hundred and twenty g thick hot milk into a cup.
- Take the saucepan with the hot tea decoction. Using a strainer, strain one-quarter to seventy nine and 0.2 g hot tea decoction in the cup with the thick milk. Adjust to taste depending on how strong or milky you want your Irani Chai.
- Stir gently and serve Irani Chai hot. Prepare Irani Tea this way in for more servings.
- Irani Chai is best served hot, paired with Osmania biscuits, bun maska, or khari biscuits.
- It also goes well with simple bakery-style cakes or rusk for a classic chai-time experience.

270,Lemon Cake Recipe (With Lemon Drizzle),,"prep_step:
- Fresh Lemons: Use fresh lemons for the best flavour. Bottled juice doesn’t give the same aroma and flavor.
- Zesting Lemons: Zest only the yellow peel. The white layer underneath can make the cake slightly bitter.
- Folding Cake Batter: Don’t overmix the batter. Fold just until the dry ingredients are incorporated.
- Flour Variants: Whole wheat flour makes the crumb a bit denser. If you want a lighter texture, use all-purpose flour. You can also make this cake pastry flour.
- Adjusting Consistency: If the batter looks too thick, add a splash of milk.
- Quick Browning: If the lemon cake browns too fast on top, loosely cover it with parchment paper and continue baking.
- More Lemon Flavor: For a stronger lemon taste, increase the zest slightly or brush warm lemon juice on the cake before glazing. You can even use fresh limes instead of lemons to make a lime cake.
- Sugar: While I use organic sugar, feel free to use white granulated sugar or brown sugar. If you prefer reduce the sugar for a lesser sweet taste.
- Adding Salt: If using salted butter do not add salt.
- Sift the dry ingredients once and set aside.
- Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F) for 20 minutes.

- Place the pan with melted butter on the kitchen counter.
- Add condensed milk, milk, sugar and vanilla.
- Mix well with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula for 4 to 5 minutes until smooth and evenly mixed. Ensure that the sugar granules are also dissolved.

- Pour this wet mixture into the sifted dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
- Add the lemon zest and lemon juice.
- Fold everything gently into a medium-thick batter. Fold only till the mixture looks even. Don’t overmix.

279,Paneer Butter Masala Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Tomatoes : Ripe, red tomatoes form the base. When not in season, use canned whole tomatoes for better flavor.
- Cashews : Adds creaminess and a hint of sweetness. Swap with soaked almonds or skip for nut-free. See my Paneer Makhani for a cream-only version.
- Cream : Thickens and enriches the sauce. For lighter curry, skip it. For vegan, use coconut cream.
- Butter : Brings richness and a buttery note. Use vegan butter or neutral oil for plant-based.
- Paneer : Fresh paneer works best. Homemade is ideal, but packaged paneer is fine if softened before cooking. For vegan, use firm tofu or tempeh.
- Spices & Herbs : Kashmiri red chili powder for color, garam masala for warmth, kasuri methi for depth, coriander leaves for garnish. The only whole spice is tej patta (bay leaf).
- Soak cashews in a hot water for 15 to 20 minutes. When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, preparing ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.
- Then drain and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder.
- Add 2 to forty five ml water and blend to a smooth and fine paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews.
- In the same blender add the roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.
- Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.
- Melt butter in a pan on a low heat. Add tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil become fragrant.
- Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about 10 to 12 seconds till the raw aroma disappears.
- Add the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes stirring a few times on low to medium heat.
- Next add kashmiri red chili powder and stir again. Continue to sauté till the oil starts to leave the sides of the tomato paste. The tomato paste will thicken considerably and will start coming together as one whole lump.
- Then add cashew paste and stir well. Sauté the cashew paste for a few minutes till the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala paste.
- The cashew paste will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. So keep stirring non-stop.
- Add water and mix very well. Simmer on a low to medium-low heat.
- The curry will come to a boil.
- After 2 to 3 minutes of boiling, add ginger julienne. Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.
- Add julienned ginger and green chillies, salt and sugar and simmer till the curry begins to thicken.
- After 3 to 4 minutes, add slit green chillies. also add salt as per taste and one-half to five g sugar (optional).
- You can vary the sugar quantity from one and one-quarter g to five g or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes. Sugar is optional and you can skip it too. If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar.
- Mix very well and simmer for a minute.
- After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes and stir gently. I keep the gravy to a medium consistency.
- After that add crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves), garam masala and cream. Gently mix and then switch off the heat.
- Garnish the curry with coriander leaves and ginger julienne.
- You can even dot the gravy with some butter or drizzle some cream.
- Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot with plain naan, garlic naan, roti, paratha or steamed basmati or jeera rice or even peas pulao.
- Side accompaniments can be an onion-cucumber salad or some pickle. Also serve some lemon wedges by the side.

- Butter: Use good quality butter. You can add both unsalted or salted butter. Also both yellow butter or white butter can be added.
- Tomatoes: It is best to use fresh, ripe red tomatoes. Add tomatoes which have sweet-tangy taste. Do not add tomatoes which are too sour or tart.
- Tomato puree: Blend the tomatoes to a smooth puree. If you want you can strain the tomato puree also.
- Sautéing tomato puree: The tomato puree has to be cooked and sautéed very well. Oil or butter should leave sides of the cooked tomato puree so that the raw flavor of tomatoes is not felt in the dish.

- Sugar: Addition of sugar depends upon your taste as well as the tanginess present in the tomatoes. So add as per taste. If you add cream then you might have to add less sugar.
- Taste and flavor: If the butter paneer masala gravy tastes tangy or sour, then to balance the sour taste you can add a bit of sugar or cream. But do not add too much sugar as then the gravy becomes too sweet. Also, do note if you add cream then you might have to add less sugar in the sauce or gravy.
- Color: To get the bright orangish-red color, its best to use kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch instead of artificial food colors. Using deep red colored tomatoes also contribute to a lovely orange color in the gravy.
- Frying paneer (optional): You can fry the paneer cubes if you want and then add in the prepared sauce or gravy.

- Sugar – Either unrefined cane sugar or white sugar will work. When you make aam panna with sugar, it will have a light cream, pale yellow, or lemon yellow color to it.
- Jaggery – Aam panna made with jaggery has a different taste than the one made with sugar. The color of aam panna made with jaggery will be light yellow to a deep yellow depending on the color of jaggery.
- Evaporated sugarcane juice – when evaporated sugarcane juice is added, the aam panna will again taste different than the other options and will have a dark brown color to it.
- Rinse the raw mangoes in water a couple of times. Place the mangoes in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Add four hundred and eighty ml water.
- Pressure cook for 2 whistles on medium flame or for about 8 to 10 minutes.
- When pressure settles down on its own, then remove the lid. The mangoes would have become soft. The peels would have also separated  if the mangoes are cooked well.
- Gently pour the contents of the cooker in a fine strainer. Place a bowl underneath. Do not discard the water. Use this water to make aam panna drink.
- Let the mangoes cool at room temperature. Place them in a bowl. After cooking the raw mangoes, the peel comes off easily.
- With a sharp-edged spoon or a knife scrape and remove the cooked mango pulp directly in the bowl. Scrape from the peels also.
- Collect the cooked mango pulp in a bowl. Discard the peels.
- As a rule always add double the amount of jaggery or sugar to the mango pulp. The ratio is 1:2 for mango pulp and jaggery respectively. So before adding sugar or jaggery measure the amount of mango pulp in a measuring cup. If you get two hundred and forty g of mango pulp, then add four hundred and eighty g of sugar. I got about one hundred and eighty g of mango pulp and so added 1.one thousand two hundred g sugar.
- Now add the required amount of sugar or jaggery.
- Add cardamom powder, roasted cumin powder, black salt, crushed black pepper or pepper powder. Mix very well. You could also use a blender or hand churner to blend the aam panna syrup.
- Pour the aam panna syrup in a clean glass bottle or jar. Store the bottle or jar in the fridge.
- For making aam panna drink, add 2 to forty five g of aam panna syrup in a glass.
- Add the water in which the mangoes were cooked or chilled water. You can also add water at room temperature.
- Stir and mix well.
- Serve aam panna. You can also add some ice cubes while serving. You can even garnish with some mint leaves or coriander leaves or lemon wedges.
- Rinse and then wipe dry the mangoes.
- Keep a roti rack or papad rack on a gas stove top. Place the mangoes on it.Keep on turning them at intervals so that they are charred and cooked evenly.The peels should get charred.
- To check doneness, slid a knife on one of the sides and the knife should slid easily without any resistance.
- Keep the roasted mangoes aside and let them cool at room temperature. You can also keep them in water for some minutes and then peel them. Once they cool down, then remove the charred peels. Remove the peels well.
- Slice the mangoes.Add the sliced mango pulp to a blender or mixer jar. Then add mint leaves, roasted cumin powder, black salt and sugar.
- For aam panna, the sugar is added twice of the mango pulp. I had got slightly more than one hundred and twenty g of mango pulp. Thus I added two hundred and forty g sugar.
- Depending on the type and quality of mangoes the amount of pulp will vary. So do measure the pulp before you add sugar. So if you get lets say, two hundred and forty g mango pulp, then add four hundred and eighty g sugar.
- Without adding any water, blend till smooth.The aam panna syrup should have a smooth consistency. If there are fibers in the pulp, then do strain it. Remove in a clean small jar or bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
- Add 2 to forty five g of the aam panna syrup in a glass. Then add water and mix very well. Add ice cubes if you like.
- Serve aam panna immediately. You can garnish with mint leaves if you want.
- Add more sugar or jaggery for a more sweet taste in any of the aam ka panna recipes.
- You can also steam the mangoes or cook these in a pan on the stovetop or in an Instant pot. Remember they have to become soft, so that the peels and the pulp comes out easily.
- Use unripe green and tart mangoes. The mangoes have to be sour.
- Avoid using mangoes which are fibrous.
- Usually, I do not remove the mango peels, but you can remove them and then cook the mangoes.
- The ratio for mango pulp and sugar or jaggery is is 1:2 respectively. So measure the amount of mango pulp in a measuring cup before adding sugar or jaggery. If you get two hundred and forty g of mango pulp, then add four hundred and eighty g of sugar.
- Some mint leaves or coriander leaves can also be ground with the mango pulp in a mixer-grinder. Addition of any of these fresh herbs gives a different taste and flavor to aam panna.
- For the roasted aam panna recipe, you can opt to use semi-ripe mangoes.
- Both the recipes can be tripled, doubled or halved.
- Note that the servings and the approximate nutrition info is for 1 serving of aam panna made by steaming the mangoes.

287,Strawberry Milkshake Recipe: Classic & Plant Based,,"prep_step:
- First, hull and chop 200 to two hundred and fifty g of fresh strawberries (22 to 25 berries).
- Add them in a blender cup along with 2.one thousand two hundred g of almond milk, two and one-half g of vanilla extract (or vanilla powder or half of a small vanilla bean scraped), plus 1 to thirty g of raw sugar or powdered jaggery or maple syrup. You can also add a scoop of non-dairy vanilla or strawberry ice cream or sapodilla ice cream when blending for an extra thick vegan shake.
- Blend until smooth.
- Pour into two tall glasses. If you like, place a scoop of the plant-based ice cream in the milkshake. Vegan vanilla ice cream and strawberry ice cream are my favorites for this recipe.
- Garnish the milkshake with some chopped strawberries or nuts. I topped with some vegan sapodilla ice cream ( chikoo ice cream ).
- Serve the strawberry almond milkshakes immediately.
- Strawberries: If possible use sweet and ripe strawberries. This will eliminate the need to add any extra sweeteners, and therefore makes this a healthy Strawberry Milkshake recipe.
- Creamy Thick Shakes: You can also make a thicker, creamier shake by using frozen strawberries. Flash freeze fresh strawberries by rinsing, hulling, and placing on a baking sheet. Then place in the freezer for an hour or so before blending.
- Flavoring Options: Feel free to add your choice of flavorings like vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, mint leaves, lavender or ground green cardamom while blending.
- Ice Cream Shake: For a richer and thicker milkshake, blend in 2 to 3 scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream or Strawberry Ice Cream . Or, like I’ve done here, simply top the shake with 1 to 2 scoops before serving.
- Sweeteners: Including any sweetener is optional and I recommend that you only add it if your strawberries are not sweet. Add your preferred choice of sweetener such as jaggery, granulated sugar, maple syrup or coconut sugar.
- First rinse the strawberries very well in water using a strainer or colander. Drain all of the water.
- Slice off the green leafy part from all the strawberries. Then chop the strawberries.
- Add the chopped strawberries to a blender together with four hundred and eighty g of cold or chilled milk.
- Optionally add the raw sugar or as needed. If the strawberries are very sweet, then you don't need to add any sugar or sweetener of choice.
- To make a thicker and creamier shake, add 2 to 3 scoops of vanilla or strawberry ice cream in the blender.
- Blend until smooth.

289,Banana Milkshake Recipe | Wholesome Banana Shake,,"prep_step:
- Milk: Although I prefer plant based milks like coconut milk or almond milk for this Banana Shake recipe, you can prepare a tasty milkshake with cashew milk, oats milk or even soy milk.
- Bananas: You can also use overripe bananas as well as frozen bananas for this milkshake recipe. Frozen ones will result in a creamier and thicker shake. When using overripe bananas, adjust the quantity of sugar depending on the sweetness of the bananas.
- Thicker milkshake: As is, this drink is quite smooth and creamy. To make a thicker milkshake similar to what you’d find in the U.S., simply add a handful of ice cubes while blending. You also can flash freeze the banana slices on a baking sheet for one hour before using or use a vegan vanilla ice cream.

291,Aloo Kofta Recipe (Potato Kofta Curry),,"prep_step:
- For the masala paste, you can even use 14 to 15 cashews in place of almonds. Grind the masala paste smoothly, without any water.
- I have used processed cheese in this kofta recipe. You can use paneer too. If you don’t want to use black pepper in the kofta mixture, add chopped green chilies or red chili powder instead.
- If your koftas are breaking in the hot oil, add about seven and one-half g to fifteen g more of cornstarch to bind the mixture. In case using paneer also, you will have to add more cornstarch since paneer leaves moisture.
- I shallow fry the koftas. You can air-fry or bake them too.
- If you are using homemade garam masala powder in the gravy, add one and one-quarter g. If using store-bought, add two and one-half g.
- Remember not to add the fried koftas directly in the gravy in the pan. This can cause the koftas to break since they are light and soft textured.
- First boil or steam the potatoes until they are thoroughly cooked. Allow them to become warm. Opt to cook potatoes in a pan, steamer, instant pot or a stovetop pressure cooker, adding water as required.
- In another pan or bowl, heat water until it boils and add the tomatoes, onion (quartered) and almonds. Turn off the heat. Instead of almonds, you can use cashews.
- Cover with lid and set aside to blanch for 20 minutes.
- You can opt to heat water in a pan, electric heater or microwave.
- After 20 minutes of blanching, drain all the water. Set the onions, tomatoes and almonds aside.
- Roughly chop the onions, tomatoes and add to a grinder or blender.
- Also peel the almonds and add to the grinder or blender.
- Grind to a smooth and fine paste without adding water. Set this curry paste aside.
- When the potatoes, become warm, peel them. Mash very well with a potato masher.

- Mix very well.
- Shape to medium sized patties.
- Heat sixty ml oil in a tawa or flat skillet. First place a small portion of the mixture to check if it breaks or not.
- If the tiny kofta does not break, then you can safely place the koftas in the hot oil. If breaking, then add more cornstarch to bind the mixture and form the patties.
- Turn over when one side gets golden.
- Fry the other side and flip again to get an even golden color. You can also air-fry these potato kofta instead of shallow frying.
- Place the aloo koftas which are done on kitchen paper towels. Continue frying the ones which are not done. Set the koftas aside.

292,Potato Curry Recipe (Indian Aloo Curry),,"prep_step:
- Potato Type: For Indian curry or gravy recipes, the potato varieties that are well suited are red skinned potatoes, Yukon gold (yellow potatoes), baby potatoes and Russet potatoes.
- Using Boiled or Mashed Potatoes: If you have leftover boiled potatoes or simple unseasoned mashed potatoes, add them at the step when the tomatoes are soft and pulpy. Then, add salt and two hundred and forty ml water or as required. Mix and simmer for 5 minutes. You can add less or more water, according to the consistency you prefer.
- Tomatoes: In India, we get fresh tomatoes throughout the year. So, canned tomatoes is something unheard of with most folks. If you do not have access to fresh tomatoes, use one hundred and twenty g tomato puree or two hundred and forty g chopped or crushed canned tomatoes.
- Choice of Fat: You can use any neutral flavored oil to make this curry recipe. For instance, peanut oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil or even avocado oil.
- Spices: The list of ground spices in the recipe are the basic Indian ones which you can easily find online on Amazon or in an Indian or Asian grocery store.
- Garam masala powder: One of the most important spice mixes added to many dishes in North Indian cuisine is the garam masala powder. Replace it with two and one-half g curry powder, if you do not have it. Or make your own with my trusted and tried Garam Masala Recipe .
- Heat oil in a pan or wok or kadai. You can use any neutral flavored oil. My personal preference is to use peanut oil for this recipe.
- Add finely chopped garlic and sauté for a few seconds. No need to brown garlic.
- Next add chopped onions. Keep on stirring in intervals and sauté on medium-low or medium heat until they turn translucent and are softened.
- Next add the chopped tomatoes and mix very well.
- Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a low or medium-low heat till the tomatoes soften and become mushy. Do check a couple of times when the tomatoes are cooking.
- When the tomatoes have softened nicely and turned mushy lower the heat. Add turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and cumin powder (optional).
- Mix the ground spice powders thoroughly with the onion-tomato mixture.
- Next add diced potatoes. Season with salt as required. Mix very well.
- Pour four hundred and eighty ml water and mix again.
- Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a medium to medium-high heat until the potatoes are cooked well.
- The potatoes may take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook and become fork tender depending on their quality and the size of the diced cubes.
- Do check a couple of times when the curry is simmering.
- The curry will thicken slightly by the time the potatoes are done.
- You can adjust the consistency of the curry as per your needs. Example if you want to serve this potato curry with rice then you can add a bit more water and let the curry be slightly thin in consistency. In case you are planing to have it with roti or plain paratha, then you can add less water and make the curry consistency more thick.
- Once you get the desired consistency in the curry and the potatoes are fork tender, turn off the heat and add chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well.
- Serve this simple basic Indian Potato Curry hot or warm with your preferred side dish. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer.
- Indian breads: Roti, paratha, poori pair nicely with this potato curry.
- Rice: Steamed white rice or jeera rice also tastes good with aloo curry.

- Garam masala powder: One of the most important spice mixes added to many dishes in North Indian cuisine is the garam masala powder. Replace it with two and one-half g curry powder, if you do not have it. Or make your own with my trusted and tried Garam Masala Recipe .
- Heat oil in a pan or wok or kadai. You can use any neutral flavored oil. My personal preference is to use peanut oil for this recipe.
- Add finely chopped garlic and sauté for a few seconds. No need to brown garlic.
- Next add chopped onions. Keep on stirring in intervals and sauté on medium-low or medium heat until they turn translucent and are softened.
- Next add the chopped tomatoes and mix very well.
- Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a low or medium-low heat till the tomatoes soften and become mushy. Do check a couple of times when the tomatoes are cooking.
- When the tomatoes have softened nicely and turned mushy lower the heat. Add turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and cumin powder (optional).
- Mix the ground spice powders thoroughly with the onion-tomato mixture.
- Next add diced potatoes. Season with salt as required. Mix very well.
- Pour four hundred and eighty ml water and mix again.
- Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a medium to medium-high heat until the potatoes are cooked well.
- The potatoes may take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook and become fork tender depending on their quality and the size of the diced cubes.
- Do check a couple of times when the curry is simmering.
- The curry will thicken slightly by the time the potatoes are done.
- You can adjust the consistency of the curry as per your needs. Example if you want to serve this potato curry with rice then you can add a bit more water and let the curry be slightly thin in consistency. In case you are planing to have it with roti or plain paratha, then you can add less water and make the curry consistency more thick.
- Once you get the desired consistency in the curry and the potatoes are fork tender, turn off the heat and add chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well.
- Serve this simple basic Indian Potato Curry hot or warm with your preferred side dish. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer.
- Indian breads: Roti, paratha, poori pair nicely with this potato curry.
- Rice: Steamed white rice or jeera rice also tastes good with aloo curry.
- Baked breads: Any good loaf of white bread or whole grain bread pairs well with potato curry. You can also serve it with dinner rolls.",15,25,40,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

296,Paneer Do Pyaza Recipe (Restaurant Style),,"prep_step:
- Paneer: For best results, make this recipe with fresh, homemade paneer. If using packaged paneer, I suggest to choose malai paneer. For frozen paneer, follow the package instructions, prior to adding in the gravy.

298,Jeera Rice Recipe (Jeera Pulao),,"prep_step:
- Serve it with creamy dals like Dal Makhani or Dal Tadka .
- Pair it with rich gravies such as Paneer Butter Masala or Matar Paneer or Palak Paneer .
- Enjoy it with light and comforting dishes like Kadhi Pakora or Rajma Masala .
- It also makes a simple yet satisfying meal when served with Chana Masala .
- Choose the right basmati: For that signature fluffy, non-sticky texture, start with top-quality basmati rice. Aged basmati is ideal – it cooks up into long, separate grains that hold their shape beautifully. You can also use sella basmati (parboiled basmati rice), which delivers equally impressive results with a slightly firmer bite.
- Soak for perfect texture: Soaking the rice for 20 to 30 minutes helps the grains swell and cook evenly. It also reduces the cooking time and the amount of water needed. Think of it as giving the rice a head start – it pays off in perfectly cooked grains.
- Rinse for fluffiness: Always rinse your rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. This removes excess surface starch, which can cause clumping. A few extra rinses lead to that light, airy texture where every grain shines on its own.
- Get the water ratio right: The ideal rice-to-water ratio depends on the type and quality of your basmati: Soaked rice (stovetop): two hundred and forty g rice to 1one-half to four hundred and eighty ml water Un-soaked rice (stovetop): two hundred and forty g rice to 2 to 2one hundred and twenty ml water and Pressure cooker: two hundred and forty g rice to 1one-half to 1one hundred and eighty ml water. Organic varieties often need slightly more water. Trust your experience and adjust based on what works best with your preferred brand.
- Soaked rice (stovetop): two hundred and forty g rice to 1one-half to four hundred and eighty ml water
- Un-soaked rice (stovetop): two hundred and forty g rice to 2 to 2one hundred and twenty ml water and
- Pressure cooker: two hundred and forty g rice to 1one-half to 1one hundred and eighty ml water.
- Organic varieties often need slightly more water. Trust your experience and adjust based on what works best with your preferred brand.
- Handle with care: If you need to stir the rice while it cooks, use a fork – not a spoon – to avoid breaking the grains. And keep stirring to a bare minimum. Let the rice cook gently and undisturbed for the best texture.
- Bloom the spices right: When it’s time to fry the cumin and whole spices, make sure the oil or ghee is hot – but not smoking. The cumin should sizzle and release its nutty aroma immediately. This step is key to infusing the rice with bold, toasty flavors. Just don’t let the spices burn – move quickly to the next step as soon as they bloom.
- The hidden gem, mace (javitri): Here’s a little secret from my spice box – mace. This delicate, lacy spice adds a subtly sweet, warm depth to the dish that’s hard to pinpoint but impossible to miss. It’s my signature twist, and once you try it, you’ll never want to leave it out.
- Leftover Rice: If using leftover rice to make the restaurant style version, you will need about seven hundred and twenty g of cooked rice. Ensure that the leftover rice is cooled completely before you temper it.
- Rinse basmati rice, 3 to 4 times in water or until the water runs clear of starch.
- Soak the basmati rice in water for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Later using a colander drain all the water from the rice and set aside.
- Heat oil or ghee in a heavy pan or pot. Keep the heat to medium-low or medium.
- Let the oil or ghee become hot on a medium-low to medium heat.
- Add cumin seeds and stir. The cumin will begin to crackle.
- Quickly add all the whole spices – cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamoms, tej patta, star anise (optional), cloves, black peppercorns and mace strands.
- Fry for a few seconds or until the spices crackle and become aromatic. Do not burn the spices.
- Immediately add the soaked rice. Then lower the heat.
- Stir and sauté the rice for 1 to 2 minutes so that the oil or oil ghee coats each rice grain.
- Add 1one-half to four hundred and eighty ml of water or as required depending on the quality of rice.
- Add salt according to taste and mix very well. Check the taste of the water and it should taste a bit salty.
- Cover the pan with a lid. On a low to medium-low heat simmer until the rice grains are tender and cooked well. You can opt to cook the rice until al dente.
- Using a fork, do check a couple of times when the rice is cooking. If all the water has been absorbed and the rice grains are not tender, then add some more hot water and gently stir to combine with a fork.
- The rice should get cooked but not become mushy or pasty.
- When the rice is done, gently fluff the rice with a fork. Cooking basmati rice takes about 12 to 20 minutes, depending on its quality and age.
- Add the coriander leaves and mix gently. Optionally garnish with coriander leaves instead of mixing.
- Serve Jeera Rice with any Indian dal or any curry of your choice.

301,Tomato Pappu (Classic Andhra Dal With Tomatoes),,"prep_step:
- With Tamarind : Add a small marble-sized ball of tamarind (soaked in warm water and extracted) toward the end of cooking for a tangier flavor. This variation is common in some Andhra households.
- Adding Spinach (Palakura Pappu) : Add a handful of chopped spinach along with the tomatoes for a more nutritious version. It becomes a lovely combination of greens and lentils.
- Garlic Flavor : Increase the number of garlic cloves in the tempering for a stronger garlicky taste, which many people love paired with rice and ghee.
- Spicy Version : Add a teaspoon of red chili powder after sautéing the tomatoes for a spicier version. Some even add a pinch of garam masala, though it’s less traditional. You can also add more green chillies.
- No Onion No Garlic Option : Skip onion and garlic entirely for a satvic or temple-style preparation. It still tastes delicious due to the tomatoes and tempering spices.
- Tomatoes : Use ripe and juicy tomatoes for the best taste. Slightly sour tomatoes add a beautiful tanginess.
- Lentils: Use fresh lentils, which are in its shelf period. Don’t use aged tur dal. I recommend using unpolished tuvar dal for the best taste.
- Red Chillies: Instead of green chilies, you can also add dried red chilies. Remember to remove their seeds.
- Skipping Ginger: If you are not fond of ginger, then only add the garlic paste or finely chopped garlic.
- Consistency : Adjust the water according to your preference. Some prefer a thicker consistency, while others like it slightly runny. So alter the consistency of this dal by adding more or less water.
- Dal Texture : Mash the cooked dal lightly for a smoother texture. If you prefer chunky lentils, mash very lightly or skip it.
- Gluten-free Lentils: For a gluten-free tomato dal, omit the asafoetida (hing) or use a gluten free asafoetida in this recipe.
- Pick and rinse arhar dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the arhar dal (pigeon pea lentils) in fresh water for 15 to 20 minutes.
- Later drain all the water from the dal and keep the arhar dal aside.

315,Methi Matar Malai Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Fenugreek Leaves (Methi): If the fenugreek leaves are too bitter, chop the leaves and take them in a bowl. Sprinkle some salt and mix very well. Keep aside for 15 minutes. Then, squeeze the leaves in your palms to remove the bitter juices. You could rinse again in fresh water if you prefer.
- Green Peas (Matar): You can add either fresh green peas or frozen green peas. Make sure to boil or steam the green peas before you add to the curry. Do not throw away the cooking water. Use the green peas stock instead of water for even more flavor.
- Homemade Cream (Malai): If using homemade malai, refrigerate about sixty g of clotted cream or malai first. Then, whip till it turns smooth and soft. Don’t add warm malai or clotted cream straightaway from the milk as this won’t give you a good creamy texture. I used packaged light cream but you can get the same results with fresh malai. You don’t need to whip or beat the cream, if you are using packaged cream.
- Whipping or heavy cream: When you include whipping or heavy cream in the recipe, then add sixty g of either. Adjust the consistency by adding some water if required.
- Vegan version: For a vegan recipe, feel free to use coconut cream instead of malai, or make the dish using almond paste or almond flour. With coconut cream, there’ll be the coconut flavor in the dish.
- Jain version: To make a Jain version of Methi Matar Malai, skip onion and garlic and make a paste of green chilies, ginger, cashews and cumin seeds. Heat the oil and add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) before adding the spice paste. From there, the rest of the recipe remains the same.
- Begin by preparing the ingredients. First rinse the fenugreek leaves thoroughly in water. Drain the water completely and then chop the leaves.
- Meanwhile cook the green peas. Though fresh green peas taste best, you can use frozen peas too.
- Rinse them a few times in water. To cook green peas in a small pan, just add them in about 1one hundred and twenty ml water or as needed. Boil for 7 to 8 minutes or until the peas are softened and tender.
- Once the peas are softened, strain them. At this point you could reserve about one hundred and twenty g of the green peas cooked water, if you prefer. For garnish, opt to set aside about 1 to thirty g of the cooked green peas.
- You could also steam the green peas in a 6 quart Instant Pot for 3 to 5 minutes adding about 1 to 1.six thousand ml water in the steel insert.
- You can also boil the green peas in a 2 litre stove-top pressure cooker for 5 to 6 minutes adding water as required. The water should cover the green peas completely. Reserve one hundred and twenty g of the cooked water if you have boiled the peas.
- In a grinder jar or blender, add cumin seeds, chopped onions, cashews, garlic, ginger and green chilies.
- Blend or grind to a fine and smooth paste without adding any water.
- If your blender or grinder is not able blend or grind effectively, then you can add 1 to thirty ml of water to the ingredients and continue to blend or grind to a fine paste.
- Heat ghee (clarified butter) or oil in a pan or kadai.
- When the ghee melts or becomes lightly hot, add the ground paste.
- Sauté the paste for 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium-low heat until you see the fat separating from the sides.
- Stir often when sautéing so that the paste does not stick to the pan. You should see fat releasing from the sides and the paste will also have a nice aroma.
- You will see the paste coming together and becoming glossy. Do not brown the paste.
- If the ground paste sticks to the pan or gets browned add a few splashes of water. Mix, deglaze and continue to sauté.
- Add in the chopped fenugreek leaves and sauté further for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Then add one hundred and twenty ml water or the stock/water in which the green peas were cooked in two parts. First add sixty ml water or green peas stock and mix thoroughly. Next add the remaining sixty g and mix again.
- Simmer the gravy for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir at intervals.
- Add the boiled peas and cream. Stir and mix to combine.
- Continue to simmer the gravy for 5 to 6 minutes on a low heat. If the consistency appears to be too thick, add some water to thin it slightly.
- Finally add the sugar, salt and mix again. At this step, you can opt to sprinkle 2 to 3 pinches of garam masala powder. Feel free to adjust the salt and sugar according to your taste.
- If the consistency looks too thick for your liking, add a bit of water to thin the consistency slightly.
- Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve Methi Matar Malai hot or warm with naan, paratha or roti.
- If the fenugreek leaves are too bitter, chop the leaves and take them in a bowl. Sprinkle some salt and mix very well. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes. Later, squeeze the leaves in your palms to extract the bitter juices. Rinse them again if needed.
- You can add either fresh green peas or frozen green peas. Make sure to boil or steam the green peas before you add to the curry.
- If using homemade malai, refrigerate about sixty g of clotted cream or malai first. Then, whip till it turns smooth and soft. Don’t add warm malai (or clotted cream) straightaway from the milk or without whipping it as this won’t give you a good creamy texture. I used packaged light cream but you can get the same results with fresh malai.
- You don’t need to whip or beat the cream, if you are using packaged cream.
- When you include whipping or heavy cream in the recipe, then add sixty g of either. Adjust the consistency, by adding some water if needed.

316,Kofta Recipe | Veg Kofta Curry,,"prep_step:
- Firstly either grate or mince veggies in a food processor or a food chopper or with a grater.
- Make a coarse mince of the veggies. I have used raw green peas and minced it along with the other veggies. If you do not have a food processor or chopper, then boil or steam peas, potatoes and cauliflower separately. Drain of all the water. Then mash very well and add to finely chopped capsicum.
- If using vegetables with high water content like bottle gourd (lauki), cabbage, zucchini or pumpkin etc, then add some salt in the grated veggies. Mix very well and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes. Then squeeze the excess water. Keep this water and add later to the gravy.
- Take the veggie mixture in a bowl.
- Add sixty g grated cheese or paneer. You can use cheddar cheese or processed cheese. You can also skip adding cheese or paneer.
- Then add one and one-quarter g kashmiri red chili powder, one and one-quarter g coriander powder, one and one-quarter g garam masala powder and one and one-quarter g black pepper powder, one hundred and twenty g besan and salt as per taste.

- Chaitra Navratri 2025 will begin on 30 March and ends on 7 April 2025. Also the Sharad Navratri begins on 22 September and ends on 1 October 2025 . Literally translating to ‘nine nights’ (nava + ratri), Navratri is observed to honor Goddess Durga or Ambe Maa, and is one of the most cherished Hindu festivals. In this post, I have shared a signature collection of Navratri Recipes. The list features both the most popular Navratri Fast Recipes or Vrat Recipes as well as lesser known or unusual ones too.
- There are many ways this pious festival is celebrated throughout the vast expanse of the Indian subcontinent. There’s a unique way dedicated to each region. There are also 4 types of Navratri, resulting from the seasonal variations. Sharada Navratri that falls after monsoon is the most important and grand one.
- Navratri is one of the most celebrated festivals at my home as well. As a devi bhakt myself, I not only spend these 9 days and nights offering my prayers in the worship of Maa Durga, but also observe the ritual of fasting. And it is not just during these 9 days, for me, not a single day goes without remembering the Mother Goddess.
- Navratri festival is celebrated with the same joy, enthusiasm and adoration all over India. Although, people belonging to different parts of the country have their own special way of paying homage to the divine powers of Goddess Durga.
- Another important feature of Navratri festival are the fasts or vrats that comes along. The Navratri Recipes that I have shared in this post are definitely a must try. If fasting, this complied list of Navratri Fast Recipes will be of great help to you.
- People in North and West India religiously keep these fasts, whereas festivities of Durga Puja may not necessarily mean fasting for the people of Bengal and other parts of Eastern India.
- The same goes for South Indians, who may not strictly observe fasting. But definitely prepare food without the addition of onion and garlic during this time. People in South India also worship deities and make sundals or sweets to offer as prasadam. Golu, a lovely display of deities’ idols, dolls and animal figures is set up in many homes during Navratri festival.
- From North to South and East to West, here’s how Navratri festival is celebrated pan India:

- Even if you feel that some of the recipes have long procedures, you just have to follow them properly which makes the making of the dish quite simple. As onions, garlic and many other spices and herbs are not allowed during these fasting days, you really don’t have to get yourself to chopping and prepping these.
- Keeping all these things in mind, I will also repeat once again that you must skip or alter the ingredients according the traditions followed in your own family. Most of the Navratri Fast Recipes in this curation are without onion and garlic, but some may have cereal flours.
- In such cases, you can substitute cornflour or gram flour with special vrat flours like water chestnut flour (singhare ka atta), buckwheat flour (kuttu ka atta), arrowroot flour or potato starch. Also, remember to use edible rock salt (sendha namak) in recipes where I have not added it.
- Navratri Recipes, especially the Navratri Fast Recipes are not only quick to prepare, but also easy to digest. Hence, this festival is a good time to purify or detoxify your body and mind, and get connected to Durga Maa and your inner conscience, through the route of divinity.

323,Gucchi Mushroom (Morel Mushroom) – About & Pulao Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Proper soaking is the key: Soak the basmati rice for about 20 to 30 minutes before cooking. This helps the grains stay separate and fluffy. Gucchi mushroom, on the other hand, requires a deeper soak to soften and cleanse thoroughly. A good soak in warm water for at least 30 minutes helps dislodge any hidden grit and prepares it for cooking.
- Clean the mushrooms thoroughly: Morel mushrooms are known for their deep crevices, which can trap a lot of dirt. Rinse them multiple times and trim the stems to ensure they’re clean. The soaking not only cleanses them but also rehydrates the mushrooms, making them tender and flavorful.
- Cook with ghee for authentic flavor: Ghee brings a rich, nutty aroma that complements the earthy taste of gucchi beautifully. While you can use high-quality oil as a substitute for a lighter version, ghee remains the traditional choice and significantly enhances the Gucchi Pulao’s depth of flavor.
- Try dum cooking for a traditional touch: For a more authentic experience, consider using the dum method. Seal the pot with dough or cover tightly with a lid and cook on low heat. This technique traps the steam, allowing the spices and mushrooms to infuse the rice deeply, resulting in an aromatic, flavorful dish.
- Use saffron: Saffron adds both elegance and aroma. A small amount goes a long way. Soak the strands in warm water or milk before adding them to the rice to fully extract their golden hue and rich fragrance.
- Boost flavor with extra spices: Feel free to customize the spice blend with a pinch of garam masala, crushed black pepper or a hint of ground mace. You can opt to add ginger-garlic paste and also herbs like coriander or mint. These additions can add complexity and elevate the flavor profile of the Gucchi Pulao.
- Garnish with fried nuts & raisins: To give the Gucchi Pulao a rich finish, sauté cashews, almonds and golden raisins in ghee and sprinkle them over the rice. The nuts add a delightful crunch, while the raisins lend a hint of sweetness that balances the savory notes – an age-old technique used in many royal Indian rice dishes.
- Rinse and soak basmati rice in water for 20 to 30 minutes. Once soaked, drain the water and set the rice aside.
- Soak the gucchi mushrooms in warm water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain water.
- Trim off the lower part of the stalk to remove any dirt, then rinse the mushrooms several times under running water using a bowl.
- After cleaning, soak the mushrooms in hot water for 30 minutes.
- Once soaked, drain the mushrooms and chop them into smaller pieces if needed.
- Filter the soaking water through a fine strainer to remove any grit or mud, and set this water aside for later use.
- In a large pan or pressure cooker, heat ghee over medium heat.
- Add the whole spices: green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom, tej patta (bay leaf), cinnamon stick, and cumin seeds.
- Fry them for about 15 to 30 seconds, or until they release their aroma.
- Add thinly sliced onions to the pan and sauté them until they turn golden brown and caramelized, which should take about 8 to 10 minutes.
- Once the onions are golden, remove 1 to thirty g of the fried onions for garnish and set them aside.
- Add the soaked morel mushrooms to the pan and sauté them on low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing them to absorb the flavors of the spices and ghee.
- Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pan and sauté it for a minute or two, gently mixing it with the mushrooms and spices. Add salt to taste.
- Pour in the reserved mushroom soaking water and stir gently.
- Cover the pan with its lid and reduce the heat to medium-low.
- Let the rice cook until tender and all the water is absorbed, which will take about 15 to 20 minutes.
- While the rice is cooking, soak saffron strands in warm water.
- Once the pulao is done, drizzle the saffron-soaked water over the cooked rice.
- Gently fluff the rice and mix the saffron water through the cooked rice for added aroma and color.
- Finally, garnish the pulao with the fried onions you set aside earlier.
- Serve the Morel Mushroom Rice hot with a side of yogurt or your favorite raita.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge and consume within 1 day. Reheat gently with a splash of water to retain moisture.

quick_step:
- Proper soaking is the key: Soak the basmati rice for about 20 to 30 minutes before cooking. This helps the grains stay separate and fluffy. Gucchi mushroom, on the other hand, requires a deeper soak to soften and cleanse thoroughly. A good soak in warm water for at least 30 minutes helps dislodge any hidden grit and prepares it for cooking.
- Clean the mushrooms thoroughly: Morel mushrooms are known for their deep crevices, which can trap a lot of dirt. Rinse them multiple times and trim the stems to ensure they’re clean. The soaking not only cleanses them but also rehydrates the mushrooms, making them tender and flavorful.
- Cook with ghee for authentic flavor: Ghee brings a rich, nutty aroma that complements the earthy taste of gucchi beautifully. While you can use high-quality oil as a substitute for a lighter version, ghee remains the traditional choice and significantly enhances the Gucchi Pulao’s depth of flavor.
- Try dum cooking for a traditional touch: For a more authentic experience, consider using the dum method. Seal the pot with dough or cover tightly with a lid and cook on low heat. This technique traps the steam, allowing the spices and mushrooms to infuse the rice deeply, resulting in an aromatic, flavorful dish.
- Use saffron: Saffron adds both elegance and aroma. A small amount goes a long way. Soak the strands in warm water or milk before adding them to the rice to fully extract their golden hue and rich fragrance.

- Boost flavor with extra spices: Feel free to customize the spice blend with a pinch of garam masala, crushed black pepper or a hint of ground mace. You can opt to add ginger-garlic paste and also herbs like coriander or mint. These additions can add complexity and elevate the flavor profile of the Gucchi Pulao.
- Garnish with fried nuts & raisins: To give the Gucchi Pulao a rich finish, sauté cashews, almonds and golden raisins in ghee and sprinkle them over the rice. The nuts add a delightful crunch, while the raisins lend a hint of sweetness that balances the savory notes – an age-old technique used in many royal Indian rice dishes.

332,Dalia Recipe | Daliya Khichdi,,"prep_step:
- Type of Dalia: Use a finer or medium-fine variety of Dalia. It should not be too coarse. The recipe can also be made with millet dalia like jowar dalia. Only you will need to adjust the water accordingly when making the recipe with varietiies of millet dalia. Bulgur wheat can be used instead of broken wheat.
- Rinsing: Always rinse the dalia to remove any chaff, dust or impurities. The broken wheat can be rinsed just before preparing the dish as it hardly takes any time to rinse and strain it. But you can prep by rinsing it earlier.
- Vegetables: You can add your choice of vegetables in this khichdi for more nutrition. Also, you can use either fresh or frozen green peas. Feel free to include veggies like carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, bottle gourd, potatoes, peas, green beans and pumpkin. Make a note that yegetables when chopped in small cubes cook easily and give a better cohesive consistency.
- Adjusting Spices: Whenever you are making this khichdi for people who are not recovering from any illness or sickness, you can amp it up by adding more spices, herbs and seasonings.
- Fats: If you want to make a vegetarian version of this khichdi, use ghee (clarified butter) instead of oil .
- Liquids: You can use a more flavorful vegetable stock in place of water to cook this khichdi.
- Dalia & Water Proportions: For a softer consistency, add 3.5 to nine hundred and sixty ml water for two hundred and forty g of dalia. For a more thinner and loose consistency, add more water.
- Pressure Cooking: Daliya cooks the best in a pressure cooker. You could a stovetop pressure cooker like I have done or use an Instant Pot. To cook in the Instant Pot, pressure cook for 8 to 10 minutes and then do a natural release.
- In a fine strainer, take the dalia or broken wheat. Gently rinse under running water a few times and set aside.
- Rinse and chop the vegetables in small cubes. Set aside.
- Finely chop the onions, tomatoes, ginger and green chillies.
- Heat oil or ghee in a 3-litre stovetop pressure cooker.
- Keep the heat to medium-low. Splutter the cumin seeds first in the hot oil.
- Add the chopped onions and sauté until they soften and become translucent on medium-low to medium heat.

- Pressure cook on medium heat for 10 to 12 whistles (or 11 to 13 minutes) or until the dalia has softened and cooked thoroughly. Time taken to cook will vary depending upon the quality of dalia.
- When the pressure drops naturally in the cooker, then only open the lid of the cooker. Check whether the daliya has softened and cooked really well.
- If the daliya is undercooked, then add some more water and pressure cook for a few whistles more or cook without the lid till they are softened and you get a porridge-like consistency.
- Pour the Daliya Khichdi in bowls. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot or warm.
- Drizzle some ghee or lemon juice on the dalia if you prefer.

336,Carrot Rice Recipe (Easy & Healthy),,"prep_step:
- Rice: You can use any Indian variety of non-sticky rice to make this recipe. I make Carrot Rice with Indian varieties of rice but any non-Indian varieties or strains of rice would also work well. You just have to adjust the water and cooking time. If you live outside India, you will find the Indian varieties of rice at your local Indian grocery stores or on Amazon.
- Use leftover rice: Take seven hundred and twenty g of leftover steamed or cooked rice and follow the rest of the steps to make this dish. This way, you can fasten the process of making this Carrot Rice even more.
- Vegetables: You can even add more veggies like bell peppers, steamed green peas or corn kernels, cabbage in this recipe.
- Onion: A variety of onions can be included. Shallots, pearl onions, scallions, red, white and yellow onions – all work great in this recipe.
- Green chilies: A bit of heat balances the sweetness in this recipe. You can swap green chili peppers for any hot pepper of your choice. Simply add about two and one-half g of it, or one and one-quarter g cayenne pepper or red chili powder.
- Spices: This recipe is a South Indian version of Carrot Rice. So, the spices included are the ones used frequently in South Indian Food . You can skip mustard seeds, but not cinnamon, cloves and green cardamom. Instead of mustard, you can add cumin seeds. Curry leaves and asafoetida can be omitted.
- Dry fruits and nuts: If you do not have cashews or raisins, skip them or add the nuts that you have.
- Oil: Neutral flavored oils are a better option for this recipe. That being said, even coconut oil works wonderfully.
- Soak rice in a bowl in enough water for 30 minutes. Drain and then set aside.
- You could use any rice like sona masuri, surti kolam or parimal rice or even basmati rice. I used hand pounded sona masuri rice.
- Add the rice in a 2 litre pressure cooker along with 0.75 to two hundred and forty ml water and salt (optional). Pressure cook for 2 whistles.
- Since this rice was hand pounded rice, I cooked for 3 whistles and added 1.six thousand ml water.
- You can also cook the rice in a pot or pan adding 3 to 3.one thousand two hundred ml water. Then drain the water once the rice grains are cooked.
- When the rice is cooking, peel and grate 2 medium sized carrots. Keep the grated carrots aside. Also slice 1 small onion and chop one green chili.
- When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid of the cooker.
- Gently fluff the rice grains and allow them to cool completely. I cooled the rice in the cooker itself. But you can also take the rice grains in a large plate or tray to cool them.
- In a pan heat the oil and add the thinly sliced onions.
- Stir and saute the onions on a low to medium heat until onions start to turn light golden. Add a pinch of salt for cooking the onions quickly.
- When the onions begin to get light golden, add the cashews and raisins. Mix very well.
- Sauté until the raisins become plump. By the time the raisins become plump, the onions will also get golden.
- Remove the onions, cashews and raisins with a slotted spoon and keep aside.
- In the same pan, some oil will be left. Lower the heat. Now add mustard seeds, tej patta, cinnamon, cardamoms and cloves.
- Stir and sauté until the mustard crackles.
- Now add the chopped green chilies, curry leaves and a pinch of asafetida (optional).
- Stir and saute for half a minute. Add the grated carrots. Mix very well.
- Saute the carrots for about 3 minutes on a low to medium heat. Depending on the size of gratings, the sautéing can take less or more time.
- Add the steamed rice and stir. Season with salt. Again mix very well and switch off the flame.
- Lastly add the fried onions, cashews and raisins. Also add chopped coriander leaves.
- Mix very well. You can also garnish carrot rice with the fried onions, cashews and raisins while serving.
- Serve carrot rice with a side raita or salad.
- Serve carrot rice with a side of a raita or salad. You can even pack it as a tiffin box lunch with some chutney or a veggie stir fry.
- The tangy sour flavors of an onion-tomato salad combine nicely with the mild, sweet flavors of this carrot rice.
- In fact a tangy tomato salad or even a mayo salad will pair greatly. If you do not have any veggies, simply serve carrot rice with a simple plain curd (yogurt).
- Though you mostly won't have any leftovers, but in case if you do have, then refrigerate and consume within a day. Do not keep for a longer time in the fridge. Rice is best had when freshly made.

cook_step:
- Rice: You can use any Indian variety of non-sticky rice to make this recipe. I make Carrot Rice with Indian varieties of rice but any non-Indian varieties or strains of rice would also work well. You just have to adjust the water and cooking time. If you live outside India, you will find the Indian varieties of rice at your local Indian grocery stores or on Amazon.
- Use leftover rice: Take seven hundred and twenty g of leftover steamed or cooked rice and follow the rest of the steps to make this dish. This way, you can fasten the process of making this Carrot Rice even more.

- Spices: This recipe is a South Indian version of Carrot Rice. So, the spices included are the ones used frequently in South Indian Food . You can skip mustard seeds, but not cinnamon, cloves and green cardamom. Instead of mustard, you can add cumin seeds. Curry leaves and asafoetida can be omitted.
- Dry fruits and nuts: If you do not have cashews or raisins, skip them or add the nuts that you have.
- Oil: Neutral flavored oils are a better option for this recipe. That being said, even coconut oil works wonderfully.
- Soak rice in a bowl in enough water for 30 minutes. Drain and then set aside.
- You could use any rice like sona masuri, surti kolam or parimal rice or even basmati rice. I used hand pounded sona masuri rice.
- Add the rice in a 2 litre pressure cooker along with 0.75 to two hundred and forty ml water and salt (optional). Pressure cook for 2 whistles.
- Since this rice was hand pounded rice, I cooked for 3 whistles and added 1.six thousand ml water.
- You can also cook the rice in a pot or pan adding 3 to 3.one thousand two hundred ml water. Then drain the water once the rice grains are cooked.
- When the rice is cooking, peel and grate 2 medium sized carrots. Keep the grated carrots aside. Also slice 1 small onion and chop one green chili.
- When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid of the cooker.
- Gently fluff the rice grains and allow them to cool completely. I cooled the rice in the cooker itself. But you can also take the rice grains in a large plate or tray to cool them.
- In a pan heat the oil and add the thinly sliced onions.
- Stir and saute the onions on a low to medium heat until onions start to turn light golden. Add a pinch of salt for cooking the onions quickly.
- When the onions begin to get light golden, add the cashews and raisins. Mix very well.
- Sauté until the raisins become plump. By the time the raisins become plump, the onions will also get golden.
- Remove the onions, cashews and raisins with a slotted spoon and keep aside.
- In the same pan, some oil will be left. Lower the heat. Now add mustard seeds, tej patta, cinnamon, cardamoms and cloves.
- Stir and sauté until the mustard crackles.
- Now add the chopped green chilies, curry leaves and a pinch of asafetida (optional).
- Stir and saute for half a minute. Add the grated carrots. Mix very well.
- Saute the carrots for about 3 minutes on a low to medium heat. Depending on the size of gratings, the sautéing can take less or more time.
- Add the steamed rice and stir. Season with salt. Again mix very well and switch off the flame.
- Lastly add the fried onions, cashews and raisins. Also add chopped coriander leaves.
- Mix very well. You can also garnish carrot rice with the fried onions, cashews and raisins while serving.
- Serve carrot rice with a side raita or salad.
- Serve carrot rice with a side of a raita or salad. You can even pack it as a tiffin box lunch with some chutney or a veggie stir fry.
- The tangy sour flavors of an onion-tomato salad combine nicely with the mild, sweet flavors of this carrot rice.
- In fact a tangy tomato salad or even a mayo salad will pair greatly. If you do not have any veggies, simply serve carrot rice with a simple plain curd (yogurt).
- Though you mostly won't have any leftovers, but in case if you do have, then refrigerate and consume within a day. Do not keep for a longer time in the fridge. Rice is best had when freshly made.",15,25,40,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

348,Prawn Curry (Prawn Masala),,"prep_step:
- Your masala/curry will taste the best with elevated flavors only if the onion tomato masala is sautéed well. Do not undercook these.
- Store bought garam masala is low in flavour. I use homemade so the quantity I use here is lesser. Feel free to use more if required at the finishing stage.
- Coconut is used to round out the flavors and give thickness to the curry. The dish still tastes good but I cannot assure if everyone likes that. If you decide to omit it, do not blend. Fine chop onions, tomatoes and keep the masala coarse.
- For a more creamy and rich taste, double the amount of coconut milk (not cashews). You can use either canned coconut milk or fresh homemade coconut milk. If you prefer to make your own blend a cup of raw coconut with half cup of water. Filter it and use in the recipe. Use half to blend and use the rest at the finishing stage.
- If you love your curry tangy, use little tamarind paste or tamarind water while blending. Or soak a few kokum and add them while blending. But be sure to add in lesser amounts, there is no way to go back.
- For a really hot and spicy curry, soak some dried red chilies and blend them with the sauteed ingredients. In this case you may omit the red chili powder.
- Choose prawns that have the shell on as they are fresher.
- Avoid buying prawns that have a fishy smell. Fresh prawns do not have any odor or fishy smell.
- If buying from the fresh market, look out for prawns on the ice as they are well kept. Avoid prepacked ones unless they are frozen.
- When you touch the prawn with shell, it has to be firm. Avoid buying prawns that are slimy & limp as this indicates they are not fresh & are a sign of decay. They will not taste good too.
- Look out for the right color of prawn. Fresh prawns are white or grey in color. However brown prawns will be brown in color.
- The meat of the prawns should be white without any black spots on them. Black spots begin to appear first on the head and then on the body of the prawns which are an indication of losing the freshness.
- Discard any spoilt or discolored prawns.
- Shell them first by removing the head. legs & tail. Devein them.
- Then transfer them to a bowl and pour 2 to seven hundred and twenty g of cold water. Drain and repeat rinsing them a few times. If using frozen prawns defrost them the same way and avoid thawing or defrosting in microwave or using hot water as the prawns lose their taste and texture.
- Rinse each prawn well, drain the water & place them in a bowl.
- Use them up immediately to make the prawn curry.
- Prep-up prawns: Devein and wash the prawns well with cold water. Drain the water completely. Optionally toss them in a pinch of salt, chili powder and garam masala.
- Make the masala: Heat half of the oil in a pan and saute onions till transparent. Stir in ginger garlic and saute for a minute. Add tomatoes, salt and turmeric. Saute until they break down, for 5 mins. Stir in chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder and coconut. Saute well for 3 to 5 mins until aromatic.
- Blend: Cool this and blend with half of the water and tamarind (optional) to a smooth puree.
- Cook the curry: Pour the rest of the oil and optionally fry the prawns on a medium heat, just for 2 mins. Remove them to a plate.
- Add cumin, green chili, garlic and curry leaves to the pan. Saute till the garlic smells aromatic, for 40 to 50 seconds. Pour the ground masala and add more water or coconut milk only if needed. It should have a slightly runny consistency.
- Make prawn curry : Bring to a rolling boil on a high heat and reduce to medium. Cook until the curry/masala is thick and you see traces of oil on top. Reduce the heat completely and add the prawns. Cook just until the tails curl up to C shape, meaning they are cooked. Avoid overcooking to prevent them rubbery. Taste test and add more salt or black pepper if you want.
- Garnish with coriander leaves and squeeze lemon if you want. Serve prawn curry with any jeera rice, plain rice or roti, naan or chapati.
- I have given the substitutes for ginger garlic paste. one-half inch ginger & 2 to 3 medium garlic cloves may not be accurate as it depends on many factors. To be more precise you may use three and three-quarters g each chopped.
- Little more or less coconut is okay, but adjust quantity of spices accordingly. If you like more add more, up to one hundred and twenty g (loosely measured raw coconut or coconut milk)
- Tamarind paste is different from concentrate which is stronger. Start with less and add more if you want. I use lemon at the garnishing stage and omit tamarind.

- You’ll know the difference when the flavors, textures and aroma will hit just the right spots on your palate. Which is sometimes missing from store-bought foods.
- The Diwali Snacks & Faral Recipes in this personalized list of mine can be prepared in advance, some days before or even a week earlier.
- Since many of these Diwali Recipes are deep-fried preparations, they can be stored in an airtight steel container or jar at room temperature for a longer period of time.
- Some of these Diwali Snacks Recipes are vegetarian and some are vegan. You can easily turn the vegetarian recipes vegan, by substituting ghee (clarified butter), milk, yogurt and butter with alternative vegan ingredients.
- For instance, a vegan butter or oil instead of your dairy butter, almond or cashew milk instead of dairy milk or a vegan yogurt instead of dairy yogurt.
- I have also added some cookie, sandwich and Indo-Chinese recipes in this Diwali Recipes compilation. What’s also cool about these recipes is that most of these can be easily scaled. So, no problems even if you want to make the dishes for a larger number of people.

- Drain the water. Rinse the chickpeas again in fresh water and then add them to a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker.
- Add whole spices – cinnamon, black cardamom, tej patta and cloves.
- I have also added dried amla to get the dark color in the chickpeas.
- Instead of dried amla, you can add 1 black tea bag. You can also simply cook the chickpeas plain with the spices and water.
- Pour the 2.one thousand two hundred ml of water.
- Pressure cook the chickpeas for 15 minutes on medium to medium-high heat. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally in the cooker. Then open the lid and check if the chickpeas are cooked well.
- The chickpeas must be tender, softened and have a melt in the mouth texture. They should mash easily when you press with a spoon. The cooked chickpeas must not give you any slight bite when you eat them.
- If you do not have a pressure cooker, then cook the chickpeas in a pot with plenty of water or in an Instant Pot. Cooking chickpeas in a pot will take a lot of time though.
- Remove the amla pieces which would have softened by now or the tea bag from the stock. You can also remove the whole spices from the stock, but I keep them. Keep the cooked chickpeas along with the stock aside.
- Heat oil in a kadai (wok) or a pan. Add slit whole green chilies and fry them on medium-low heat until the have some light golden blisters on them. Ensure to slit the green chilies and fry, so that they do not burst in the oil. Note that you could skip frying the green chillies if you prefer. Or opt to add 1 to 2 green chilies in the masala while sautéing.
- Place the fried green chilies on kitchen paper towels for any excess oil to be drained.
- In the same oil, add the carom seeds. Sauté for a few seconds until the carom seeds are fragrant.
- Add finely chopped onions. Stir and sauté until the onions turn translucent or light brown.
- Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté until their raw aroma goes away.

- Sauté until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala.
- When the oil starts separating from the onion and tomato masala and it looks glossy, at this point add the chickpeas along with the stock (the water in which the chickpeas were cooked). You could also opt to add fresh water instead of the stock.
- Mix well and then add salt and dry mango powder.
- Stir again and simmer the curry on medium-low to medium heat. You can also mash a few chickpeas with the back of the spoon to thicken the gravy.
- Simmer till the gravy has thickened. You will also see some oil specks floating at the top of the gravy.

- Serve Chana Masala hot garnished with coriander leaves paired with bhatura or pooris or naan or roti.
- As a side accompaniment serve the Chana Masala with sliced onions, tomatoes and lime or lemon. You can also add some fried potato cubes as a topping and serve.

- Adding a pinch of baking soda also helps in making the chickpeas soft.
- Instead of garam masala powder, you can also add chana masala powder or Punjabi garam masala powder.
- Skip adding amla or tea bags, if you do not have them.
- If you do include dried amla or Indian Gooseberry, you will see a brown shade in the chickpeas. Opt to remove the amla pieces which would have softened or keep them if you prefer. If you do choose to keep them, then let them become warm and mash them very well with a spoon or a mortar-pestle. Add this mashed amla to the masala gravy. When you do so, you may not need to add the dry mango powder, as the gravy will be naturally tangy due to the amla and tastes splendid.
- If cooking chickpeas in the pan or pot then: You have to take enough water in the pot while cooking the chickpeas. It takes a lot of time though. For 1.5 to four hundred and eighty g of soaked & drained chickpeas, you can take about 4 to one thousand two hundred ml of water. Adding a pinch of baking soda in the water along with salt, also helps in the cooking process and the chickpeas become really soft when cooked. You can add about five g of salt. A little less salt is also alright. I usually add less salt. Cover the pot and cook. If the water starts to become frothy, then remove the lid and cook for some minutes.

- Do not add acidic ingredients like lemon or tomatoes to the pan before sauteing the mutton for a while. Most times both these acidic ingredients tend to make the meat tough when added before sauteing. So add tomatoes after sauteing the mutton.
- Marinate mutton with salt, ginger garlic, turmeric, garam masala or meat masala, chili powder and curd. Yogurt & ginger garlic paste are natural meat tenderizers so they make the mutton succulent.
- Set aside until you prepare the rest or leave it in the refrigerator to marinate overnight. (When you are ready to cook, leave the cold mutton out on the counter for 30 mins to bring the meat closer to room temperature.)
- On a low to medium flame, gently heat oil in a pan or pressure cooker. Add the whole spices – cinnamon, cardamoms and bay leaf (optional), followed by onions & green chilies.
- Saute until onions turn golden. Lower the flame to very low as much as possible.  Then transfer the marinated mutton and saute for 5 to 7 mins.
- Stir in the meat masala & curry leaves (optional), followed by pureed tomatoes.
- Increase the heat to medium and saute for another 5 to 7 mins, until the raw flavor of tomatoes has reduced. Pour hot water & mix well.
- To cook in a regular pot: Bring it to a gentle boil and cook covered on a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir well every 12 to 15 minutes and pour more hot water in batches as needed.
- Stovetop Pressure Cooker: Pressure cook on a medium heat for 4 to 5 whistles, depending on the kind or cooker, meat and size of the mutton pieces.
- When the pressure drops, open the lid and mix well. If the curry is runny, cook/saute for a few more minutes to evaporate some of the moisture. Your mutton is cooked through when it is tender, flakes easily with a fork and falls off the bone easily.
- Taste the curry and add more salt if needed. If you feel it is low on flavor, you may sprinkle little garam masala. Garnish with fine chopped coriander leaves.
- Serve mutton curry hot with rice, tandoori roti, naan or plain paratha.
- Mutton: Bone-in mutton imparts deeper flavors to the curry, but bone-less will also work. You can use lamb/goat leg or shoulder or a mix of all.
- Marinade: It is essential to marinate the mutton for a tender and succulent chunks of meat. There is a huge difference in the flavor and texture of marinated vs not marinated mutton.
- Meat Masala is stronger in flavor than regular garam masala. It has red chilies included in it. Using a lot of meat masala can easily make your dish very hot. At the last stage you may add some garam masala if you want for more flavor.
- Onions: You don’t need to brown the onions for this recipe. Saute them until golden and they will dissolve in the curry.
- Tomatoes: Make sure you saute the mutton well before adding the tomatoes.

cook_step:
- Firstly to make a delicious mutton curry, the choice of meat is very important. Choose fresh and tender cuts as this helps to get soft & succulent mutton after cooking. Leg, shoulder, rump or a mix of all these is used to make a curry.

365,Mutton Korma (Goat Korma),,"prep_step:
- To transform basic korma to a shahi korma, soak 12 almonds or cashews in sixty ml boiling water. Almonds will need a overnight soak and cashews need 10 to 15 mins. Grind them with sixty ml milk or heavy cream or water to a smooth puree. You may add more liquid to get your blender running. Add this during the last 10 mins of cooking.
- Heat 1seven and one-half ml ghee in a small pan and add thirty g sliced or silvered almonds or 10 blanched almonds. Fry them on a medium heat until light golden. Turn off the stove and pour this on the Mutton korma. Garnish with extra fried onions.
- Always cook the mutton korma on a low heat because that release all the goodness from the marrow.
- Add the ground onions when the mutton is almost cooked. This retains the aroma and texture of the onions. Avoid adding it too early else you will lose the fried onion flavor.
- Do not make a smooth paste, grind them to a coarse powder or paste. You want a unique texture in the korma sauce.
- Always marinate the mutton as this process helps to tenderize and enhance the flavor of the meat. The longer it rests the more succulent & tender it turns out. You can also marinate the previous night & refrigerate. Ensure it comes to room temperature before you begin to cook.
- Fried onions is the star of any korma recipe, so prefer making them at home. You can also make it ahead and refrigerate in a glass jar. Avoid store bought fried onions fried in vanaspathi or vegetable margarine as it ruins the entire dish.
- To a large heavy bottom pot or Dutch oven, add mutton, cloves, cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamoms, black pepper, salt, turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, green chili, ginger garlic paste and yogurt .
- Mix well to marinate. Cover and rest aside until your fried onions are ready. Alternately you may refrigerate overnight. (Bring it close to room temperature, place on the counter for 1one-half hours before cooking)
- Heat ghee in a wide heavy bottom pan. Separate the layers of onions and slide them to the ghee. Saute on a medium heat for 7 mins, lower the flame and saute for another 4 to 5 mins, until golden. Remove to a plate, retaining most of the ghee in the pan.
- Cool these completely and pulse them coarsely in a small grinder with a few tablespoons water or yogurt. (if your grinder is unable to grind, add more liquid)
- Make sure your mutton is close to room temperature before you begin to cook. Add forty five ml ghee/oil to the marinade. (Use the leftover shallow fried onion ghee and add more to top up if required.)
- Begin to saute/braise the mutton on a medium heat for about 12 to 15 mins. Yogurt and mutton lets out lot of moisture. Cover and let the mutton cook in this for 30 mins.
- Add the crushed onions and pour hot water. Mix well and cook covered on a low heat stirring every 10 mins, until mutton turns tender to your liking. It takes me another 1one-quarter hours for tender and fall off the bone meat. (add more hot water as required while you cook). Turn off the heat.
- Stir in mace, nutmeg, cardamom powder and kewra water. Taste test to adjust salt.
- Mutton korma tastes best if you let it rest for at least an hour. Serve with naan, roti, paratha, sheermal and rice varieties.
- Do not use sour yogurt. Make sure it is full fat and fresh.
- To deep fry onions – Heat oil on a medium flame. Meanwhile, spread the onions on a tray and add five g corn starch to a small strainer. Shake the corn starch all over the onions. Coat evenly with your fingers. When the oil is hot, fry them in 2 to 3 batches, until golden and crisp. Grind this without any liquid in your grinder to a coarse powder.
- Be cautious while using mace and nutmeg. Too much mace can make your dish bitter.
- If you feel your mutton korma is low on flavor, add a little garam masala during the last 2 mins.
- If using store bought fried onions, make sure they are not fried in vanaspati/dalda or palm oil because that alters the flavors significantly.

370,Rogan Josh Recipe (Lamb Rogan Josh),,"prep_step:
- This step is optional. But it helps to thicken the rogan josh. Heat 1.seventy five ml oil in a pan and saute shallots/onions on a medium heat until golden, about to caramelize but not burnt. Cool them and blend with 2 to forty five ml of yogurt to a smooth paste. Keep this aside.
- Heat oil or ghee in a heavy bottom pot and add bay leaf, green cardamoms, cinnamon, cloves and black cardamoms. (If you opt for the ground spices, add them later.)
- When the spices begin to sizzle in oil, add mutton and sear it for 1 to 2 minute on a high heat.
- Reduce the heat to medium and fry for another 4 to 5 minutes until the meat is slightly brown.
- While you fry the meat, add yogurt to a mixing bowl. Also add ground spices – red chilli powder, fennel powder, dried ginger powder and salt.
- Whisk all of them well. If your yogurt is too thick (like Greek yogurt), add 3 to sixty ml of water or stock and whisk it well until smooth.
- Once the meat is light brown in color, add hing to the oil. Take the pot off the stove and slowly stir in the spice and yogurt mixture.
- Mix well and place the pot back on the stove. Cook covered for 3 to 4 minutes on a medium heat.
- Pour two hundred and forty ml hot water or stock. Cook covered on a low heat until tender, adding more hot water if required.
- Stir rogan josh every 7 to 8 minutes. When it is done, the mutton pieces should be soft, tender and fall off the bone. ( Optional – During the last 20 minutes of cooking add the blended onion paste and mix well.)
- The cook time depends on the kind of pot, source of heat and the intensity of heat. Do not forget to add more hot water (if required) as you cook. It takes me 2 hours for the mutton to get tender.
- The gravy in Rogan josh is neither too runny nor too thick but is slightly thick as the some of the bone marrow seeps into the liquids. This results can be achieved only by slow cooking the dish.
- Taste test and add more salt or garam masala if required. Turn off the heat and rest for few hours before serving. This helps to develop the flavors.
- Serve rogan josh with plain steamed basmati rice, Saffron Rice , Tandoori Roti , Butter Naan , Paratha or Roti.
- If using mustard oil, first heat it until smoking hot. Reduce the heat and then begin to cook.
- My spice combination makes this recipe the best. However if you do not have whole spices, then use garam masala plus fennel powder and fresh ginger paste.
- If using fresh ginger paste, add it when the mutton is light brown. Slide the mutton to a side and add the ginger paste to ghee/oil. Fry quickly until aromatic without burning.
- This recipe has been updated to use onions/shallots (for a thicker gravy) and garam masala. These are not used in the traditional rogan josh.
- To use pran, skip using yogurt and use 4 to 5 tbsps of pran paste along with the ground spices. After searing the mutton, pour hot water or stock and cook until 50% done (half cooked). Then add all the ground spices and the pran paste.
- If using store bought bottled pran, make sure it is fresh and does not smell rancid. Pran stored in glass containers and made with ghee keeps good for longer.

- Preheat the outdoor grill for medium high heat.
- Grease the grate generously with oil. Wipe off the excess marinade from the chicken and place them over the preheated grill.
- Cook for 5 to 6 mins and turn them the other side. Baste the marinade on the top side and turn it again after 5 to 6 mins. The cook time depends on the size of your chicken pieces.
- It takes about 27 to 30 mins to cook the Tandoori chicken fully. Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken and cook until it shows 165 F or 75 C. Brush with some butter or mustard oil.
- In a large mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, ginger garlic paste, garam masala, red chili powder, salt, turmeric, kasuri methi, pepper, coriander powder, cumin powder, oil and lemon juice or chaat masala. Taste test, adjust salt and spice/heat levels to your taste.
- Pat dry chicken with paper towels and make deep slits (3 to 4 on larger thighs or 2 to 3 on smaller). Add them to the marinade & coat them well.
- Cover and rest in the refrigerator for least 6 hours to overnight.
- Preheat the oven to 470 F – 240 C. (If using a smaller oven like a OTG, preheat at  430 F – 220 C). Place a wire rack over a baking tray, lined with foil for easy cleanup. Spray oil over the wire rack.
- Arrange the marinated chicken on the rack. Roast/bake the chicken for a total of 25 to 30 mins (depending on the size of chicken), basting with leftover marinade or with chili oil/ melted butter, after the first 12 to 15 mins. (Check at 12 mins mark)
- Turn the chicken to the other side after basting and roast for another 12 to 15 minutes. Move the tray to the top rack and broil for 3 minutes to 4 mins, to get some charred spots. The timings can vary depending on your oven and the size of chicken. So adjust accordingly.
- When the chicken is cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 to 170 F (75 C). Optionally you may smoke the chicken following the steps in my post.

- You can also pan fry the kababs. Simply shape them without a skewer. Heat a tablespoon oil or ghee in a non-stick pan and place the kababs. Do not disturb them for 1 to 2 mins, turn them with a tong and cook on all the sides. I don’t prefer this method due to the splatters and clean up. But the seekh kababs are tender this way too.
- The same mixture can be used to make chicken koftas. Shape to small balls and bake or air fry at 200 C/ 390F for 8 to 10 mins. After 6 mins, shake the tray.
- It is very important to knead and rest the meat in the refrigerator. Both these help in a good binding.
- If using wooden skewers, soak them for 30 mins & pat dry very well.
- Add all the ingredients to a bowl and mix together well, for 2 to 3 mins. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes to 4 hours (if made without fresh onion).
- Preheat your oven to the highest temperature for at least 15 mins. Arrange a rack in the center.
- Take handful of mixture and begin to press down on the skewers, starting from the bottom to top or vice versa. Optionally press down with your fingers to give them a few finger impressions.
- Place them on a prepared tray, such that both the ends of the skewers rest on the edges of the tray. Make sure the meat does not touch the bottom of the tray.
- Place the baking tray in the oven and bake for 6 to 7 mins, turn them to the other side and bake for another 2 to 3 mins. (Baking times can vary depending on the size of your oven and thickness of kebabs). You know it is done, when your instant read thermometer reads 165 F in the thickest part of the skewer.
- Serve Chicken Seekh Kabab over yellow rice, with a side of mint chutney and roast veggies.
- To use fresh onion: Chop onion & stir in a pinch of salt. Let rest for 10 mins while you prepare the rest. Later squeeze out as much moisture as possible or add them to a cloth and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. They are ready to use.

- Mix well and taste test the marinade. You can adjust the spice and salt levels at this stage. The marinade should be thick and smooth. Keep this aside.
- If using bell peppers and onions, dice them to 1one-half inch sizes and keep aside.
- Pat dry the fish with kitchen tissues/paper and dice equally to 1one-half inch pieces each, the same size as that of vegetables.
- Add the fish pieces to the marinade and coat them well. Let the fish rest in the marinade for a minimum of 15 mins to a maximum of 1 hour. Leaving it for too long in the marinade can make your fish mushy.
- Keep the veggies aside and add them to the marinade only before cooking the tikkas else they release juices and ruin the marinade.
- Soak your wooden skewers in water for 30 mins to prevent burning or simply use metal skewers. Line your baking tray with a parchment paper and grease it again or spray lightly.
- Position your oven rack in the middle/Centre of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 F or 190 C for at least 15 mins.
- When you are ready to cook the tikkas, place the fish pieces to one side of the bowl. Add the diced veggies and marinate them with the rest of the marinade.
- Thread onion, bell pepper & fish/salmon onto the skewer spacing one-quarter inch apart. Repeat the same order again on each skewer. I could thread on to 5 skewers.
- Place the Fish tikka skewers on the prepared tray.
- Bake them for 8 to 9 minutes. Later using tongs turn them to the other side. Bake for another 4 to 5 minutes or until cooked through. If you want to slightly char the tikkas, move the tray to the top rack and broil for 2 mins. Adjust the timings depending on your oven as each is different.
- The internal temperature of cooked salmon should reach 145 F in the thickest part. When it is fully cooked, fish flakes easily.
- Squeeze lemon juice if required. Serve Tandoori fish tikka with Mint Chutney or Cilantro Chutney . Turmeric rice, kachumber & raita also go well.
- Line the air fryer drip pan/basket with aluminum foil for easy clean-up. If your air fryer requires preheating do it for 2 mins at 390 F or 200 C.
- Air fry the fish tikka skewers for 5 mins, if required brush them with little marinade. Turn the skewers to the other side and repeat brushing lightly.
- Air fry again for 3 to 5 mins (until the internal temperature reaches 145F), depending on the thickness and size of fish. Adjust the timings depending on your air fryer as each air fryer is different.
- Fish easily flakes when you poke a fork into it. This is an indication that it has cooked through well.
- Squeeze some lemon juice over the fish tikkas and serve with mint chutney, coriander chutney. It also goes well with Turmeric rice or lemon rice and a vegetable salad like this kachumber.
- Please note that every oven is different and the cook time may vary depending on the size and kind of your oven. So it is essential to adjust the cook time as required.
- Upon testing & retesting we found this kind of fish tikka on the skewers are best baked than broiled as the marinade cooks up uniformly without burning. This also keeps the fish/ salmon tender and moist from inside.
- If your yogurt is runny you may add 1 to 1.seventy five g of deep roasted gram flour/ besan to the marinade. Brush your tikkas generously with lemon juice or butter before serving as the flour dries up the masala.

394,Rava Idli (Easy and No Fermentation),,"prep_step:
- Leavening Agent: five g of fruit salt (Eno) is perfect for the amount of rava and curd used in the recipe. Results in soft, fluffy idlis without the soapy aroma. If you use baking soda, add one and one-quarter g (2 to 3 pinches) of it in the batter. The spices and herbs also add a lot of flavoring of their own in the recipe.
- Vegetables: I have added some grated carrots to the batter, which you can skip. You can even add steamed green peas. Just boil the peas beforehand and also grate the veggies ahead of time so they are ready to be added. You can also also include grated beets or finely shredded cabbage or finely chopped bell peppers.
- Curd (yogurt): I have used fresh curd. Both fresh or sour curd can be used to make the idli. Another variation of idli is this idli made with rice rava where cream of rice is used, instead of cream of wheat.
- Water: In case the curd you are using is thin and runny with lots of whey in it, add one hundred and twenty ml water. If it is very thick, then add one hundred and eighty ml water. Adjust the quantity of batter to get a medium consistency batter.
- Idli pan: You will need an idli pan to make these steamed cakes. Idli pans are made to fit perfectly into a pressure cooker or steamer. If you can’t find an idli maker in the market, you can always order one online from Amazon.
- Heat thirty ml ghee in a pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add the halved cashews.
- Stirring often fry the cashews till golden. Remove fried cashews with a slotted spoon draining the ghee and keep aside.
- To the same pan add mustard seeds and let them begin to splutter. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.
- When the mustard seeds begin to splutter add the chana dal. Stirring often fry chana dal till they look golden and crunchy.
- Then add the cumin seeds and fry for 4 to 5 seconds.
- Now add the chopped curry leaves, asafoetida, finely chopped ginger and green chillies. Mix well and fry for 10 seconds. Keep the heat to a low.
- Next add rava (cream of wheat, suji, semolina).
- Mix well and stirring often roast the rava till they become aromatic, change color a bit (but should not get browned or golden) and the grains look separate.
- Roasting rava will takes about 5 to 7 minutes depending on the thickness and heaviness of the pan, and the flame intensity.
- Once the rava is well roasted, keep the pan aside. Let the rava become warm.
- To the roasted rava, add finely grated carrots, chopped coriander leaves and two and one-half g salt or add as required.
- Next add curd (yogurt) and water as required. Depending on the quality of rava and the thickness of curd, you can adjust the water from one-half to one hundred and eighty g.
- If the curd is liquid and has whey in it, then add one hundred and twenty ml water. If the curd is very thick, then add one hundred and eighty ml water. Basically you need to get a medium consistency batter.
- Mix very well and let the batter rest covered for 20 minutes. The rava idli batter is neither thick nor thin in consistency and has a medium consistency.
- Brush oil or ghee on the idli pan moulds. Place a fried halved cashew in the center of the moulds.
- Also heat 2 to 2.one thousand two hundred ml water in a pot. Keep a small length trivet stand or a rack in the pot. Heat the water till it comes to a boil.
- After 20 minutes this is the consistency of the batter after resting. If in case the batter looks thick, rava idli batter looks thick, then add 1 to thirty ml of water to get a medium consistency.
- Rava absorbs water and so the batter might thicken after 20 minutes. If the curd is thick, then also you may need to add more water. If you have added more water in the beginning, then you may not need to any water at this step.
- Sprinkle five g eno or one and one-quarter g baking soda evenly over the batter. Quickly mix very well.
- Pour the batter in the idli moulds. Place them in the pot with the hot water. Cover with a lid and steam rava idli for 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat.
- To check the doneness, a bamboo skewer or fork inserted in the rava idli should come out clean. Remove the idli plates carefully and let them rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Then with a spoon remove the rava idli.
- Serve the steaming hot rava idli with sambar and your favorite coconut chutney.

396,Veg Noodles Recipe (Vegetable Noodles),,"prep_step:
- I used about 2 heaped cups of cabbage, one hundred and eighty g of carrot, sixty g of beans, one hundred and eighty g capsicum. You can use up to 3one hundred and twenty g of mixed veggies.
- Quarter the cabbage and immerse it in a bowl of warm water. Leave it for a while and repeat a few times in a bowl of fresh cold water. Drain the water completely from the cabbage. Julienne the cabbage and keep it aside. Make sure cabbage is drained well. Excess moisture can make the veggies soggy.
- Peel and julienne the carrots, bell pepper, green beans & zucchini (optional).
- Slice the green chilies and onions thin (optional).
- Always bring water to a rolling boil before adding the noodles to the water.
- Use salt and oil only if mentioned on the pack. Some kind of noodles do not require both as they are already salted.
- Cook the noodle al dente without making them mushy.  Please follow the instructions on the pack for cook time of the noodles. The cook time varies depending on the kind of noodles.
- Once the noodles are drained to the colander, rinse them well under cold water. Please check the pack of your noodles. Some kind of noodles turn limpy when put under cold water. So they should not be rinsed.
- You can also smear fifteen ml oil to the cooked noodles to prevent them from turning sticky.
- Bring one thousand two hundred ml water to a rolling boil. Add the noodles and cook al dente on a medium high heat. They should be cooked just until done & not overcooked. Follow the instructions on the pack for cook time.
- Drain them to a colander. Rinse them well under running cold water. Sprinkle five ml oil and spread it all over the noodles. This prevents them from drying out and becoming lumpy. Set aside.
- While the noodles cook, prepare the veggies & garlic.
- Rinse all the vegetables under running water. Peel the carrots and julienne all the vegetables as thin as possible (refer step by step pictures)
- To a small bowl, add all the sauces you prefer to use along with your choice of vinegar.
- Pour oil to a hot wok and spread the oil all over the wok. Regulate the flame to medium high.
- Add garlic and green chilies. Stir fry for 30 seconds and add onions (optional).
- Fry them for a minute only we don't want soft onions. Add all the veggies – carrots, bell pepper, green beans & cabbage.
- Toss & stir fry on the highest flame/heat for 2 to 3 mins until they are half done yet crunchy. Do not over cook the veggies.
- Add cooked noodles and black pepper. Pour the prepared sauce around the sides of the wok/pan.
- Toss and stir fry for 2 mins. Taste test and add more salt or sauce to taste if want. Serve veg noodles hot or warm.
- Soya sauce: Substitute soya sauce with tamari for a gluten-free option and coconut aminos for a soya-free option. If you want to avoid all of these you may add a star anise and strand of mace to the tempering just before garlic. This infuses some magical flavors to your noodles.
- Vinegar adds a tang to your noodles. Rice vinegar is commonly used in Indo-Chinese cooking. However you may replace with apple cider vinegar or lemon juice.
- You can skip the hot sauce, if you use hot green chilies.
- You can skip all sauces and vinegar in the recipe if you are using a carbon steel or bare cast iron wok. Make sure you stir fry the noodles on a high flame which imparts a slightly smoky flavor to the dish.

398,Veg Manchurian Recipe with Manchurian Sauce,,"prep_step:
- For authentic Chinese smoky flavors use a carbon steel wok and stir fry on a highest flame until you add the sauces, then turn down the flame and cook further.
- Do not add a lot of flour or starch to the mixed veggies as they make the manchurian balls hard. Instead you can add bread crumbs.
- Adding too much of bread crumbs will alter the taste of the balls. You should not have the dominating taste of bread in the balls. So add more only if needed.
- The manchurian balls can be fried in the paniyaram pan, just skip the flour and beans. Use only the bread crumbs. Fry them on a medium flame turning them all around for even cooking.
- If frying the balls in the paniyaram pan then, ensure you do not make the balls too big. I cook these in a cast iron paniyaram pan so they cook well inside but I am not sure if they turn out good in a non stick.

- Do not disturb them for 1 min after the balls are dropped in oil.
- They will be delicate and may break if you have not used bread crumbs.
- After few seconds of frying, you can keep stirring and fry until they turn golden.
- Drain them on a kitchen tissue.
- Baking in Oven – Preheat the oven and bake the balls on a greased wire rack placed over a tray at 200 C for 20 to 23 mins.

- Homemade Sambar Mix: In the recipe, freshly roasted and ground sambar powder is made. This sambar powder adds a lot of flavor in the sambar. If you are short of time, then you can use any sambar powder you have and make this recipe. Note that the final taste of the sambar depends a lot on the type of sambar powder added. So, use a good quality sambar powder or use your homemade Sambar Powder .
- Roasting Spices: While roasting the spices for the sambar powder, use a heavy or a thick-bottomed pan on low heat. Stir continuously, so that the spices do not get burnt. The spices have to be roasted until they turn fragrant and golden. Use fresh spices and make sure they are not rancid.
- Vegetables To Add: Tomato is one of the key ingredients in this sambar, which adds a lot of flavor. So, do not skip it. For the vegetables, add the ones that are usually added in sambar. Do try to add drumsticks, if you can, as in most hotel style sambars, it is added. It gives a nice taste in the sambar. You can also add carrots, green beans, flat beans, ladyfingers (okra), brinjals, potatoes, pumpkin, ash gourd, onions, etc.
- Lentils: Both tuvar dal and masoor dal are added in the sambar served in hotels. If you do not have masoor dal, just add tuvar dal. You can also add some moong dal in combination with tuvar and masoor dal.
- Rinse both the lentils well and then add them in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker with 1.25 to 1.one thousand two hundred ml water and one and one-quarter g turmeric powder.
- Pressure cook the lentils for 7 to 8 whistles or 11 to 12 minutes until the lentils have softened and well cooked.
- You can also cook the lentils in a pan on a stove top or in the instant pot. I recommend to soak the lentils for about 30 minutes in enough water prior to cooking them in a pan. This helps in the faster cooking of the lentils.
- Once the pressure settles down naturally in the cooker, open the cooker. Mash the lentils with a wired whisk and spoon. Keep aside.
- In a small and heavy frying pan, heat ten ml oil. Keep the heat to a low. First, add the mustard seeds.

- Dice the brinjals and add them in water to prevent discoloration.
- Chop the tomatoes in small pieces.
- In a pan, heat oil first. Add the mustard seeds and let them begin to crackle. Then add the urad dal and sauté till they turn to a maroonish color.
- Add quartered onions or halved pearl onions, curry leaves and asafoetida. Stir and saute for 2 minutes till the onions soften a bit.
- Add the tomatoes, salt as required and continue to saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low heat.
- Then add the veggies which take a longer time to cook (carrots, beans, potatoes, drumsticks etc) and saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low flame.
- Then add remaining quick-cooking veggies like brinjals, ladyfingers (okra), pumpkin etc now. Stir and mix.
- Add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.six thousand ml water.

- Add two hundred and forty ml water or as required depending on the consistency you want.
- Stir and simmer without lid for about 6 to 7 minutes or till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals.

- While serving place the idli in a serving bowl. Pour sambar. Garnish with some coriander leaves. You can even drizzle a bit of ghee on top. Serve idli sambar hot.
- You can also garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with medu vada, idli, dosa, uttapam or even with steamed rice.

- In a bowl or pan, take the following ingredients – rice, urad dal, 7 to 8 fenugreek seeds. I have used idli rice. You can also use short grained regular rice like sona masuri rice.
- Rinse all the ingredients for a couple of times in water. Drain and set aside.
- Next, in a separate bowl or pan or cup, take the thick poha. Rinse the poha once or twice with water.
- Strain and add the poha to the bowl containing rice, urad dal, methi seeds.
- Add 1.one thousand two hundred ml of water and soak all the ingredients for 5 to 6 hours.
- Later, drain the soaked water very well. Reserve the strained water. We will use this strained water for grinding. Or opt to use fresh water while grinding the rice and lentils
- Now add half of the soaked ingredients in a high speed grinder or blender. Depending on the size of the jar, you can grind in one lot or in batches.
- Add one hundred and twenty ml water and grind very well. The rice grains can have a consistency of that like idli rawa.

I added a total of one hundred and eighty ml water while grinding. If the grinder becomes hot, then wait for it to cool down and then continue with the grinding.
- Add sugar to the batter in the bowl.

- The tawa has to be medium hot and not very hot. If very hot, the dosa gets too browned or can get burnt with uneven cooking. If the tawa is warm, then the dosa does not become soft and the air-pockets do not get formed on the dosa. While making these dosas, you can regulate the heat from low to medium.
- Take a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the tawa. Just spread the batter very lightly to make a small and slightly thick dosa.

406,Gobi Manchurian Recipe | Cauliflower Manchurian,,"prep_step:
- Oil for deep frying as needed
- Cut gobi to medium size separate florets and add them to seven hundred and twenty g of slightly hot water (not boiling hot). Rest for 5 mins, discard the water and rinse with cold water. Drain them to a colander.
- Spread on a clean cloth or pat dry with paper tissues, to remove excess moisture. You can do this ahead and set aside at room temperature. Any moisture in the gobi will cook it to soft and not crisp.
- Heat up the oil for deep frying on a medium heat.
- Meanwhile make the batter by adding cornstarch, all-purpose flour, red chilli powder, black pepper and salt to a mixing bowl.
- Mix and add water little by little as needed and make a free flowing lump-free batter. The consistency has to be medium and not too thick or very runny. Adjust salt as needed by tasting the batter. (check video)
- Add the gobi florets to the batter (in batches), coat them well.
- When the oil turns hot enough, check by dropping a small amount of batter to the hot oil. The batter has to sizzle and rise to the surface without browning. This is the correct temperature.
- Pick up each cauliflower floret with a spoon or fingers & gently drop them one by one to the hot oil. The flame has to be medium initially and should be increased slightly as more gobi is added. Avoid disturbing/ stirring them for 1 to 2 minutes, as the coating can easily turn messy.
- Reduce the flame to medium and fry until the florets turn golden and crisp. Keep stirring in between for even frying. Remove them with a spider, shaking gently to get rid of the excess oil.
- Transfer to a kitchen tissue/paper towel or a steel colander. Repeat the same steps of adding the rest of the cauliflower florets to the batter, coating them well and then frying them in hot oil until crisp. Oil should be medium hot and not smoking hot, before you fry the next batch.
- For extra crisp gobi manchurian, you can also refry the once fried gobi again in oil. I usually do not do it as frying them once is good enough to get very good crisp manchurian with this recipe.
- Optional: Mix together red chili powder with little water (fifteen g) to a paste and keep aside. This step is optional and is used mainly for the red color.
- Prepare the sauce: Add soya sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, red chili paste, sugar and vinegar to a small bowl and keep this aside. (for gravy version refer the notes section below).
- Heat oil in a wide pan or wok. Add garlic, ginger and green chilies. Saute for a minute or two.
- Then add spring onions whites & bell pepper. Saute them on a high flame for 2 mins.
- Pour the sauce and water. Mix well and cook stirring until the sauce turns thick. Add black pepper and turn off the heat.
- Taste test and adjust the heat and salt levels to your taste. The sauce has to be slightly tangy, sweet & hot. If you want you may add more sauce to preference.
- Allow the sauce to cool for 1 to 2 mins. Add the fried cauliflower and stir gently to coat well with the manchurian sauce.
- Garnish gobi manchurian with spring onion greens. Serve immediately as a appetizer or as a side with noodles or fried rice.
- Red chilli sauce is a sweet, hot and slightly tangy sauce. If you do not have it, use 1 to 2 tsps of any hot sauce along with tomato ketchup. Adjust the sugar as well.
- Double the amount of soya sauce, chilli sauce, sugar, vinegar and tomato sauce (ketchup). Use red chilli powder as required. I double it.
- Mix five g corn flour with half cup water. Stir in to the bubbling sauces. Taste and adjust the sweet, spice & tang.
- Triple the amount of soya sauce, chilli sauce, sugar, vinegar & tomato sauce (ketchup). I triple the red chilli powder as well for this. But if you want it less spicy then you may just double it.
- Mix eleven and one-quarter g corn flour with two hundred and forty ml of water and stir in to the bubbling sauces. Taste the sauce when it thickens and adjust the sweet, spice & tang.
- Please adjust the amount of chilli powder as needed. I use a low heat chilli powder. Some readers mentioned it turned out too spicy for them. You can totally skip the chilli powder in the seasoning as it is used only for color.
- Since cauliflower is fried for long time, for health reasons discard the used oil and do not reuse it.
- Instead of frying you can also bake the cauliflower. Rinse and drain the florets. Toss the moist florets in spices first and then in 2 to 4 tbsps flour. Dust off the excess flour and place them in a greased tray. Ensure the cauliflower is moist otherwise the dry ingredients will not coat them well.

407,Medu Vada Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Use fresh urad dal : Old or aged dal doesn’t grind well and can make the vadas dense. Choose unpolished urad dal for better texture and taste.
- Grind to the right consistency : The batter should be smooth, light, and fluffy; similar to thick whipped cream or a soft cake batter. There should be no grits or coarse pieces.
- Thin batter tip: If the batter turns thin, add a small amount of urad dal flour, rice flour, or fine semolina (rava). This thickens the batter and helps make the vadas crisp.
- Flavor variations: Mix in any of these — cumin seeds, crushed black pepper, green chilies, curry leaves, coriander or mint leaves, and ginger.
- For fasting (vrat): Skip onions and keep spices simple.
- Scaling: You can easily double or triple this recipe for gatherings or festivals.
- Rinse urad dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.
- Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.
- If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.
- Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.
- Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.
- With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or ziplock bags to give the medu vada its donut shape.
- In a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium.
- Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil.
- Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.
- Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.
- Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. A very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then too the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.
- Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.
- Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil. Similarly fry remaining batches of medu vada with the batter. Any leftover batter can be refrigerated for about a day. Let the chilled batter come to room temperature before frying.
- Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. Medu vada can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.
- One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney. This vada sambar meal is finished with steaming hot filter coffee.

- Pressure cook on a medium to high heat for 7 to 8 whistles or 11 to 12 minutes.
- Let the pressure settle down on its own and then you remove the lid to check the doneness and consistency. If the pongal has a consistency like that of pulao, then add one-half to two hundred and forty ml hot water and mix very well.
- Both the rice and the moong dal should be cooked very well. If you want you can even slightly mash the cooked rice and moong lentils. If cooked well, then cover with the lid and keep aside.
- In another small pan, heat the ghee.
- Add the cumin seeds. Let them splutter.
- Then add the cashews. Fry until the cashews become light golden.
- Once they begin to get light golden, then add black peppercorns and 10 to 12 curry leaves.
- Stir very well and fry until the curry leaves become crisp. The black pepper should also be fried well.
- Now pour this entire tempering on the pongal. Mix very well.
- Cover with the lid (with the vent weight/whistle on the lid) and keep ven pongal aside for 5 to 6 minutes. This allows the tempering flavors to infuse with the pongal and the aroma to stay in.
- Then remove the lid and serve hot with coconut chutney or sambar.

409,Kothu Parotta | Kothu Roti,,"prep_step:
- If you’re using leftover parotta or laccha paratha, moisten it with little water to soften it.
- Add cooked vegetables, mushrooms, panner, tofu or cooked meat to serve this as a main meal.
- Don’t forget to mince the parotta well while it cooks.
- Make this healthier with whole wheat rotis or chapatis. Make sure the chapatis you use are slightly thicker than usual.
- Skip the optional eggs for a vegetarian version. This won’t affect the taste of the dish. Or use ghee and butter to enhance the flavor.
- Use any type of masala or curry powder to give the dish a spicy twist.
- Don’t have leftover roti or unable to shop for readymade parotta? Use masala pooris as the kothu base.
- Some like to give it an Indo-Chinese touch. Add some soy sauce and chili sauce to the veggies instead of garam masala.
- If you can find Sri Lankan masala powder, use it to make a different version. Cut down on chili powder as this masala is pungent on its own.
- Tear the parottas/ parathas to bite sized pieces, about 1 inch. If you do not have a sharp metal spatula, simply shred the parottas to fine pieces with a knife on your chopping board.
- Pour oil to a hot pan and add mustard seeds. When they begin to splutter, add curry leaves, ginger, garlic and green chilies.
- Saute them for 1 to 2 minutes and add chopped onions.
- Stir fry until golden and add tomatoes along with salt.
- Cook till the onions become soft and break down. Add red chilli powder, garam masala, fennel powder & turmeric.
- Saute for 1 to 2 mins. Add coriander and mint leaves, saute for another 1 to 2 minutes until aromatic.
- Pour sixty ml water. Or 2 to 3 eggs for an egg version.
- Stir well and continue to cook till most of the water is evaporated. The spicy mixture has to be moist and not dried out completely. This is very important, especially if you are not using salna. If you have used eggs in the earlier step, ensure the eggs are soft cooked and not over cooked.
- Add the paratha/ parotta/ roti pieces. Optional – Add one hundred and eighty g salna or two hundred and forty g vegetable kurma (not very runny).
- Reduce the heat to low and mix to coat the parotta with the spicy masala.
- Break the pieces finer using a sharp metal spatula or a scraper. If you find the paratha pieces too dry, sprinkle little water all over.
- Cook this on a medium heat just until hot.
- Garnish kothu parotta with coriander leaves and serve hot with a onion raita .
- Your parotta or roti may be salted so add salt only as required.
- Nutritional values are calculated on the basis of store bought parathas. It may vary if using homemade rotis.
- For a meat version, simply use chicken salna or chicken kurma. You may need to reduce the spices as meat based dishes are spicer.
- For a fussy kids’ version skip the onions, puree tomatoes and cook with little garam masala. Scramble the eggs and add the rotis. You can also add some finely chopped carrots, peas and green beans.

410,Fried Idli | Idli Fry (Mumbai Style),,"prep_step:
- To make this dish, you can use only leftover idli or a day-old idli that have been refrigerated. Don’t use fresh idli because it is soft. Thus, can break in the oil while frying and absorb a lot of oil as well. It can also stick to each other while frying.
- It is always better to refrigerate the idli for a few hours before you fry them. This way, they won’t break while frying in the hot oil.
- In case you don’t want to deep-fry the idlis, you can also either pan-fry or shallow-fry them.
- While frying idlis, the smaller pieces get fried quickly as compared to the larger pieces. So, you have to remove the small pieces first. If not done this way and fried all the pieces equally, then the outside texture of smaller pieces will turn a little dense due to extra frying and you may not like them.
- Don’t fry the idlis too brown. They should be crispy from outside and soft from inside. Frying them for a long time or browning them too much, will make for a denser and dry texture on the outside.
- Cut the refrigerated or day old idlis into wedges, as shown in the photo above in the step-by-step guide.
- Heat oil in a kadai or pan till medium hot. Add the idli fingers and deep fry till light golden or slightly more.
- Ideally, the fried idli pieces should be crispy from outside and soft from inside. You can also pan fry or shallow fry them. Do not make them too brown or golden.
- Remove the smaller pieces first as they will get fried quickly. Drain the fried idli on paper towels to remove excess oil.
- Sprinkle either red chilli powder or pav bhaji masala or chaat masala or idli podi on top and some salt. Simply mix well so that masala is coated evenly.
- Serve the Fried Idli with sambar or coconut chutney or tomato ketchup.

411,Onion Uttapam (With Homemade Batter),,"prep_step:
- In a bowl, take one hundred and twenty g whole husked urad dal and one and one-quarter g fenugreek seeds. Begin to rinse with water a few times and later drain all the water.
- Batter preparation: The key to a good uttapam lies in the batter. It’s typically made from a mixture of rice and urad dal (black gram dal), which is soaked, ground, and fermented overnight. This fermentation process gives the uttapam its characteristic tangy flavor and fluffy texture.
- Consistency of batter: Ensure that the batter for uttapam is of the right consistency – not too thick or too thin. It should be pourable but not runny. Adjust the water or batter consistency as needed to achieve this.
- Preparation of onions: Chop the onions finely for even distribution and quicker cooking. You can also soak the chopped onions in water for a few minutes to reduce their sharpness if desired. For small onions or shallots or pearl onions, consider slicing them.
- Heat level: Preheat the griddle or tawa well before pouring the batter. The surface should be hot enough to sizzle when the batter is poured, but not so hot that it burns the uttapam.
- Spreading batter: Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the hot griddle. Use the back of the ladle to gently spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thick pancake. Don’t spread it too thin; uttapam is typically thicker than dosa.
- In a bowl take the husked whole urad dal and fenugreek seeds (methi dana). Rinse both the urad dal and fenugreek seeds for a couple of times.
- Then soak these in two hundred and forty ml water for 4 to 5 hours.
- In another bowl take the parboiled rice or idli rice. Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times.
- Add four hundred and eighty ml water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.
- Strain the urad dal and reserve the soaked water. Keep this water for grinding the urad dal.
- Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or a sturdy blender.
- Add the reserved water in parts and grind to a smooth and fluffy batter.
- Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan.
- To the same grinder or blender, add the half of the rice.
- Then add one-quarter to one hundred and twenty ml water and grind till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also fine in the batter. You can grind the rice in two to three batches. Overall add one hundred and eighty ml water for grinding rice.
- Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.
- Add five g edible rock salt or as per taste.
- Mix both the batters very well with your hands or a spoon or spatula.
- Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 9 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature conditions in your city.
- The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. Just lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about one-eighth to sixty ml water or more if required. Mix well.
- Heat up a well seasoned tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. For a non stick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the heat from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the heat to low.
- Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon.
- Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake.
- Add some chopped onions. Lightly press the onions on the uttapam so that they stick to the batter.
- Drizzle with some oil on the sides and on the uttapam. Cook on a medium heat.
- When the base becomes golden and crisp, gently flip the uttapam.
- Cook the second side with the onions until the onions are golden or caramelized. You can keep the onions to a light golden, but ensure that the batter is cooked well.
- Optionally, gently press with the spatula so that the any uncooked batter also gets cooked well. If the uttapam is not cooked well, there will be raw uncooked batter in the center. So do make sure to cook it properly.
- Flip over to check if this side is cooked well. The onions will also be caramelized. You can caramelize the onions more if you like.
- I n a plate take the two hundred and forty g chopped onions, 2 or 3 chopped green chilies, 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped) and seventy nine and 0.2 g chopped coriander leaves.
- Mix very well and set aside.
- Spread the batter on the tawa and top the onion mixture on the uttapam.
- Drizzle some oil on the sides and top. Cook the uttapam on a medium-low to medium heat. When the bottom looks golden and crispy, turn over.
- Cook the second side with the toppings touching the tawa or skillet, until onions are golden or caramelized.
- Remove and serve. Similarly repeat making the onion uttapam in batches.

412,Uttapam Recipe | How To Make Uthappam,,"prep_step:
- Lentils: This recipe can be made with either husked, whole urad dal or husked, split urad dal. Ensure the lentils are fresh and in their shelf-life, and not aged or rancid.
- Type of pan: The best pan used to make these Uttapams is a cast iron pan. Or ensure using any other heavy skillet pan or tawa. The pan also has to be seasoned well. If not done so, the batter will stick to the pan.
- Choice of fat: You can use either oil, butter or ghee (clarified butter) in this recipe. Uthappam made with ghee or butter definitely taste better.
- Cooking: Make sure to cook on medium heat. Since these are thicker than dosas, they take more time to cook fully and evenly. Also, do not cook on high heat as this can lead to quick crisping and browning of the outside first, leaving the inside batter undercooked.
- Storage: The leftover batter keeps well in the refrigerator for a few days. Place it in an air-tight container and keep in the fridge. You can make dosa, uttapam, paniyaram or appe with this batter.
- In a bowl take the usked whole urad dal and fenugreek seeds. You can also use split husked urad dal instead of husked whole urad dal.
- Rinse both the urad dal and methi seeds for a couple of times with water.
- Soak them in two hundred and forty ml water for 4 to 5 hours.
- In another bowl take the parboiled rice or idli rice. Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times and set aside.
- Add four hundred and eighty ml of water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.
- Strain the urad dal and reserve the water. Keep this water for blending/grinding the dal.
- Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or blender.
- First add sixty g of the reserved water and blend for some seconds. Then add the rest of sixty ml water and continue to blend until the batter is light, smooth and fluffy. If the mixer becomes too hot while blending, then stop for a few minutes. Let the mixer cool down and blend again.
- Quantity of water depends on the freshness of urad dal. So add water as required.
- Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. The batter should be fluffy, smooth and light.
- To the same blender or grinder, add half of the rice.
- Then add one-quarter to one hundred and twenty ml water and blend till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also alright. You can blend the rice in two to three batches.
- Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.
- Add five g rock salt or as per taste. In very cold temperatures, avoid adding salt. Instead add one and one-quarter g sugar. Sugar aids in the fermentation process.
- Mix both the batters very well with a spoon or spatula.
- Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 9 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature in your city.
- The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. It will also have a pleasant sour aroma and many tiny air pockets.
- Simply lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about one-eighth to sixty ml water or more if required. Mix well.
- Heat up a tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon. For nonstick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the heat from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the heat to low.
- Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake. Note that the quantity of batter to make uttapam will be more than what you would normally use for a dosa. The uttapam must be thick.
- At this point, after spreading the batter on the tawa/griddle, you can consider add veggie toppings of chopped onions & tomatoes, grated carrots or beets, finely chopped capsicum and herbs like coriander leaves, curry leaves and green chilies.
- Cook them on a medium heat. Drizzle some oil on the top and sides.
- These pancakes takes a longer time to cook than dosa. Cook until the base is golden.
- Then flip and cook the other side.
- Both sides should be cooked well. Prepare more uthappam this way with the rest of the batter in batches.
- If there is any leftover batter, store it in the refrigerator. It keeps well for a few days. You can also make paniyaram or appe with this batter.
- Serve Uttapam hot or warm with coconut chutney and sambar. You can also pack them in tiffin box as they remain soft even after cooling.

- Type of pan: The best pan used to make these Uttapams is a cast iron pan. Or ensure using any other heavy skillet pan or tawa. The pan also has to be seasoned well. If not done so, the batter will stick to the pan.
- Choice of fat: You can use either oil, butter or ghee (clarified butter) in this recipe. Uthappam made with ghee or butter definitely taste better.
- Cooking: Make sure to cook on medium heat. Since these are thicker than dosas, they take more time to cook fully and evenly. Also, do not cook on high heat as this can lead to quick crisping and browning of the outside first, leaving the inside batter undercooked.
- Storage: The leftover batter keeps well in the refrigerator for a few days. Place it in an air-tight container and keep in the fridge. You can make dosa, uttapam, paniyaram or appe with this batter.
- In a bowl take the usked whole urad dal and fenugreek seeds. You can also use split husked urad dal instead of husked whole urad dal.
- Rinse both the urad dal and methi seeds for a couple of times with water.
- Soak them in two hundred and forty ml water for 4 to 5 hours.
- In another bowl take the parboiled rice or idli rice. Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times and set aside.
- Add four hundred and eighty ml of water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.
- Strain the urad dal and reserve the water. Keep this water for blending/grinding the dal.
- Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or blender.
- First add sixty g of the reserved water and blend for some seconds. Then add the rest of sixty ml water and continue to blend until the batter is light, smooth and fluffy. If the mixer becomes too hot while blending, then stop for a few minutes. Let the mixer cool down and blend again.
- Quantity of water depends on the freshness of urad dal. So add water as required.
- Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. The batter should be fluffy, smooth and light.
- To the same blender or grinder, add half of the rice.
- Then add one-quarter to one hundred and twenty ml water and blend till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also alright. You can blend the rice in two to three batches.
- Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.
- Add five g rock salt or as per taste. In very cold temperatures, avoid adding salt. Instead add one and one-quarter g sugar. Sugar aids in the fermentation process.
- Mix both the batters very well with a spoon or spatula.
- Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 9 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature in your city.
- The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. It will also have a pleasant sour aroma and many tiny air pockets.
- Simply lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about one-eighth to sixty ml water or more if required. Mix well.
- Heat up a tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon. For nonstick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the heat from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the heat to low.
- Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake. Note that the quantity of batter to make uttapam will be more than what you would normally use for a dosa. The uttapam must be thick.
- At this point, after spreading the batter on the tawa/griddle, you can consider add veggie toppings of chopped onions & tomatoes, grated carrots or beets, finely chopped capsicum and herbs like coriander leaves, curry leaves and green chilies.
- Cook them on a medium heat. Drizzle some oil on the top and sides.
- These pancakes takes a longer time to cook than dosa. Cook until the base is golden.
- Then flip and cook the other side.
- Both sides should be cooked well. Prepare more uthappam this way with the rest of the batter in batches.
- If there is any leftover batter, store it in the refrigerator. It keeps well for a few days. You can also make paniyaram or appe with this batter.
- Serve Uttapam hot or warm with coconut chutney and sambar. You can also pack them in tiffin box as they remain soft even after cooling.",15,15,30,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

- First roast the rice and lentils separately in a frying pan or a skillet. Then rinse both the rice and lentils a few times with water.
- Add the rinsed rise and lentils to the steel insert of a 6 quart Instant Pot.
- Pour 3.one thousand two hundred ml water. Pressure cook on high pressure for 6 to 7 minutes. Do a quick pressure release after 10 to 12 minutes.
- If you see that the consistency is thick or with separate grains, then pour some water. Mix and press the sauté button to simmer the mixture for a couple of minutes.
- Add the ground cardamom and clove powder. Make the jaggery syrup and add it. Later fry the cashews, raisins separately and mix it with the cooked rice and lentils. Serve Sweet Pongal hot or warm.

- On a low heat stirring often roast both the rice and moong lentils, till they become aromatic.
- You only need to roast till the moong lentils become aromatic. No need to brown them.
- Now take them in another bowl.
- Rinse both the roasted rice and moong dal a couple of times with water.
- Drain well and then add them in a pressure cooker.
- Pour seven hundred and twenty ml water. The amount of water you can add depends on the consistency you prefer and on the quality of moong dal.
- Pressure cook on medium heat for 11 to 12 minutes or for 8 to 9 whistles.
- Let the pressure settle down on its own in the cooker. Then remove the lid to check the doneness and consistency of the rice and lentils. If you see a separate texture like that of a pulao/pilaf, then add one-half to two hundred and forty ml hot water and mix very well.
- Both the rice and the moong dal should be cooked very well and look mushy. With a spoon, slightly mash the cooked rice and moong lentils. If cooked well, then cover with the lid and keep aside. The consistency of the cooked rice and lentils is like a khichdi.
- Meanwhile when the rice is cooking, crush seeds of 5 green cardamoms + 1 clove in a mortar-pestle. If using cardamom powder alone, then you can add two and one-half g of it.

416,"Sambar Recipe, How to Make Sambar",,"prep_step:
- Optional – Red pumpkin (2 pieces diced to 2 inch each)
- optional – Eggplant / brinjal (quartered or diced)
- Sambar powder from step 2. (or 1one-half to thirty g store bought)
- Spice powder known as sambar powder is the key to a delicious and flavourful dish. So make a good choice of the powder you are going to use. I have also shared an instant sambhar powder in this post. If you have any readymade powder you can use it. Adjust to suit your liking, i suggest using mtr powder if you cannot make fresh for the recipe. It is one of the popular south Indian brands.
- A proper combination of the veggies is also important. Use the veggies of your choice. Vegetables like brinjal, bottle gourd and cucumber do alter the taste of the dish. So use the vegetables which you think will suit your taste buds. I generally do not add any of them.
- We usually soft cook the vegetables so that all the taste from the veggies comes to the stock. This makes the sambar more tasty & flavorful.
- I use the Indian variety of Tamarind . If you prefer to use the concentrate then use with caution as it is salted & sourer in taste. Add tamarind to the sambhar only after the veggies are soft cooked else the sourness will prevent the veggies from cooking well.
- Coriander leaves or cilantro is another herb which is much needed to flavor the sambar. We usually prefer the smaller variety of coriander leaves as the ones with larger leaves are mostly hybrid & do not lend a good aroma.
- Sambar is mostly made thick but of pouring consistency. Feel free to add water as desired to bring it to a consistency you like. The tamilnadu sambhar is much thicker than the sambar made in Andhra & Karnataka.
- Traditionally sambar was tempered with ghee . However different regions use different fats. In tamilnadu sesame oil is used. In kerala coconut oil is used. But ghee lends much superior taste than any of these.
- Fresh curry leaves are a must to temper the sambhar as it lends that unique aroma. However if you live in a country where curry leaves are not available then feel free to skip them. I would not suggest using dried curry leaves as they lend a weird flavour.
- Shallots or small to medium sized onions
- Okra – ladies finger – bhindi
- Brinjal – egg plant – baingan
- Wash toor dal a few times in cooker or pot until the water runs clear.
- Pour four hundred and eighty ml water & pressure cook for 2 to 4 whistles depending on the brand of cooker.  If cooking in Instant pot, press the pressure cook button & set the timer for 9 mins. If you do not have a pressure cooker, it can be cooked in a pot until soft adding more water as needed.
- Rinse all the veggies. Scrape the drumsticks lightly & rinse. Chop them to 2 inch pieces. Peel the shallots as well & rinse.
- Dice tomatoes & chop okra to 1 inch pieces. If using pumpkin, peel the skin & dice. Keep all these aside.
- While the dal cooks, make the sambar powder. Dry roast red chilies, urad dal and chana dal until golden & crunchy. Add coriander seeds & fry till aromatic. Remove to a plate.
- Next add methi seeds and saute until slightly dark. Then add cumin, fry for a minute. Cool these and powder finely in a spice jar.
- Heat five ml oil in a pot. Saute onions for 1 minute. Add all the veggies & saute for 2 mins. This saute step can be skipped but sometimes onions, tomatoes and chilli powder don't smell good when boiled without sautéing.
- Stir in the chilli powder (optional) and pour nine hundred and sixty ml water.
- When the water turns hot, take sixty ml hot water with a ladle to a bowl. Add tamarind & jaggery (optional). Set aside to soak.
- When the veggies are cooked al dente, add turmeric, sambar powder & salt. Squeeze the tamarind and pour the tamarind water. I prefer to filter the tamarind water while pouring.
- Cook for 3 to 5 minutes. When the pressure releases, mash the dal to smooth with a masher or ladle.
- Stir it to the boiling sambar. Adjust salt and tamarind if needed. If it is too thick to your liking, add little hot water. Bring it to a gentle boil and add coriander leaves.
- Heat a small pan with ghee. Add mustard, cumin, methi & red chillies. When the spices pop, add curry leaves.
- The leaves will turn crisp, then add hing & pour this to the simmering sambar.
- Serve sambar with rice, idli, vada or dosa.
- Set aside the desired portion to refrigerate in smaller containers.
- Cool completely and refrigerate immediately. To retain the taste of sambar, refrigerate within two hours of cooking.
- It keeps good for about 2 to 4 days. Bring it to a boil & make a fresh tempering.
- I use one hundred and twenty g toor dal and sixty g moong dal. Moong dal gives a thicker texture to your sambar. You can use a mix of toor (split skinned pigeon peas), Moong dal (skinned split mung beans or green gram), Masoor (skinned split red lentils)
- Skip the red chilli powder if using store bought sambar powder.
- Do not add tamarind before the veggies are cooked completely.
- Do not overcook the dal after adding to the pot of vegetables, as the taste of dal diminishes. Add it only after the veggies are cooked. This way dal is not overcooked and sambhar tastes the best.
- Make sure dal is very smooth. In some parts of south India, dal is ground to smooth and then used.
- If you do not have shallots you can use 3 small (lemon sized) to 1 medium sized (halved) onions. The sambar will get some sweet flavor but tastes good.
- You can also use 2 to 3 red pumpkin pieces cut to inch each.

- When the veggies are cooked al dente, add turmeric, sambar powder & salt. Squeeze the tamarind and pour the tamarind water. I prefer to filter the tamarind water while pouring.
- Cook for 3 to 5 minutes. When the pressure releases, mash the dal to smooth with a masher or ladle.
- Stir it to the boiling sambar. Adjust salt and tamarind if needed. If it is too thick to your liking, add little hot water. Bring it to a gentle boil and add coriander leaves.
- Heat a small pan with ghee. Add mustard, cumin, methi & red chillies. When the spices pop, add curry leaves.
- The leaves will turn crisp, then add hing & pour this to the simmering sambar.
- Serve sambar with rice, idli, vada or dosa.
- Set aside the desired portion to refrigerate in smaller containers.
- Cool completely and refrigerate immediately. To retain the taste of sambar, refrigerate within two hours of cooking.
- It keeps good for about 2 to 4 days. Bring it to a boil & make a fresh tempering.
- I use one hundred and twenty g toor dal and sixty g moong dal. Moong dal gives a thicker texture to your sambar. You can use a mix of toor (split skinned pigeon peas), Moong dal (skinned split mung beans or green gram), Masoor (skinned split red lentils)
- Skip the red chilli powder if using store bought sambar powder.
- Do not add tamarind before the veggies are cooked completely.
- Do not overcook the dal after adding to the pot of vegetables, as the taste of dal diminishes. Add it only after the veggies are cooked. This way dal is not overcooked and sambhar tastes the best.
- Make sure dal is very smooth. In some parts of south India, dal is ground to smooth and then used.
- If you do not have shallots you can use 3 small (lemon sized) to 1 medium sized (halved) onions. The sambar will get some sweet flavor but tastes good.
- You can also use 2 to 3 red pumpkin pieces cut to inch each.",20,30,50,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635
417,Kadala Curry Recipe,,"prep_step:
- A lot of Malayalee cooks add onions and tomatoes raw while cooking the kadala. I prefer to saute the onions before pressure cooking as some kind of onions don’t impart a good flavor by directly pressure cooking.
- You can also pressure cook the kadala separately first and then add them to the sauteed onion tomato mixture. But this recipe works really well cooking them together and in fact tastes the best.
- A lot of people make traditional kadala curry without tomatoes. If you want you may skip.
- Since this recipe uses less onions and tomatoes, it does not work well if you skip coconut. Use it in some form either the coconut paste or the coconut milk.
- Rinse and soak kadala/chickpeas overnight. Later drain the water and rinse them well before cooking.
- Add fifteen ml oil to a pressure cooker or pot.  Heat it.
- Saute onions and green chilies slightly until transparent. Add ginger garlic and saute for 1 minute.
- Add the tomatoes, salt, turmeric, coriander powder and red chilli powder. Mix and saute for a few minutes.
- Add soaked kadala and pour four hundred and eighty ml water. Pressure cook for 10 whistles on a medium heat, until kadala is soft cooked.
- While the kadala cooks, on a low heat, dry roast cardamoms, fennel seeds, pepper, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, until they begin to smell good.
- Add the curry leaves and coconut. Increase the flame to medium and roast all of this until for 5 mins, stirring continuously. If you want you can also roast this until golden without burning.
- Cool and grind to as smooth as possible. Pour half cup water and blend to a very smooth paste. If required you may add 1 to 2 tbsps more water.
- When the pressure drops, check if the kadala is cooked well. They must be soft cooked.
- Add the coconut paste. Mix well. Stir and continue to cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until the curry reaches a desired consistency. Taste test and adjust salt.
- Pour 1 one-half tbsps oil to a small pan. When it is hot add mustard seeds and 1 broken red chilli. As soon as they splutter add curry leaves and sliced shallots.
- Stir fry until the onions turn golden and aromatic. Pour this directly over the hot kadala curry and cover it.

418,Poha Recipe (Kanda Poha),,"prep_step:
- Type of Poha: I use both the white and red varieties to make this dish. So both the varieties can be used to make this recipe. But always use thick or medium-thick variety to make this breakfast dish. Thin variety will become a mush and pasty after rinsing and cooking.
- Poha Texture: After rinsing, press a beaten rice flake. It will easily crush or mash if it is soft enough. You can cook with this. If not, then it must be still dry. In this case, sprinkle little water on the flattened rice flakes and mix gently.
- Rinsing Flattened Rice: I usually use a colander or strainer to rinse the flattened rice flakes under running water and not soak them. Rinsing helps to soften the flakes easily. But take care not to rinse too much or soak them in water as this can make them mushy or lumpy.
- Vegetables : To make it healthier, add boiled peas, finely chopped capsicum and grated carrots or your preferred veggies. Steam, boil, sauté, pan-fry the vegetables accordingly before you add to the dish.
- Garnish : I garnish my recipe with coriander leaves and grated fresh coconut. While I would not suggest you to skip the coriander, you can give the coconut a miss. For some cruncy and crispy texture you could also opt to garnish or top with sev or farsan.
- Taste Preferences : If you don’t like the slight sweet taste in the dish, don’t add sugar. You can also squeeze some lemon juice on the dish before eating it or opt not to. For a spicy recipe, add more green chillies. If you like a bit of gingery taste, add about two and one-half g of finely chopped or minced ginger.
- Pick the poha first of any debris or small stones. Rinse the flattened rice flakes in clean running water in a strainer or colander twice or thrice.
- Make sure that you do not rinse the poha flakes too much or else they break and get mushy. While rinsing, the poha flakes absorb enough water and they become soft.
- The poha must become soft but remain intact, whole and separate. If they do not become soft, add a splash of water on them in the strainer and mix till they get softened.
- After rinsing, the flattened rice flakes should loose their crunchiness and when you break them between your fingers, they should easily get crushed or mashed.
- When the poha have softened nicely, sprinkle the turmeric powder, sugar and salt evenly on them. Gently mix with a spoon or with clean fingers.
- Roast the peanuts in a small frying pan till they become crunchy with a few blisters on the peanut skins. Set aside.
- Also peel the potatoes and chop them into small cubes.
- In a heavy kadai, heat oil. Sauté the potatoes in medium hot oil till light golden and crisp. Stir them often for even frying.
- Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside.
- In the same kadai, there will be some oil left. Add mustard seeds to the hot oil. If there is no oil, then add fifteen ml oil and heat it gently and then add the mustard seeds.
- When the mustard seeds splutter, add the cumin seeds.
- When the cumin seeds crackle, add the onions. Sauté the onions till they become translucent and soften.
- Now add the curry leaves, chopped green chillies and roasted peanuts. Sauté for a minute on low heat.
- Add the fried potatoes and then the rinsed poha. Mix gently with the rest of the sautéed ingredients.
- Cover the pan tightly with a lid for the poha to get steamed for about 2 minutes on low heat.
- Remove the lid and check the taste and if required add more salt and sugar.
- Turn off the heat and cover the pan tightly with a lid for the poha to get steamed for a few minutes.
- Remove the lid and garnish with chopped coriander leaves and grated fresh coconut.
- Serve Kanda Poha hot with chopped lemon pieces. The lemon juice has to be squeezed on the poha before eating it.
- Alternatively, you could also follow this method. Once the poha is cooked, sprinkle about 1 to ten ml lemon juice on it.
- Mix and then garnish it with coconut and coriander leaves.

422,Milk Dalia (Indian Cracked Wheat Porridge),,"prep_step:
- Roasting dalia: Always roast the cracked wheat in a little ghee before cooking. This enhances its nutty aroma and prevents it from becoming sticky. Roast until it turns light golden for the best flavor.
- Cooking method: Cooking dalia in a pressure cooker is the quickest method and ensures a soft, well-cooked texture. If using a pan, cook it on low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, and adding water/milk gradually to prevent lumps.
- Sweetener choices: Instead of sugar, use jaggery or dates for a healthier and naturally sweet flavor. If using jaggery, add it after the dalia is cooked and slightly cooled, as direct boiling with milk can cause curdling.
- Enhancing flavor: Add saffron strands or a pinch of cinnamon for extra aroma and taste. A few drops of rose water or kewra essence can elevate the flavor, giving it a more traditional touch.
- Nuts and dry fruit additions: Garnish milk dalia with chopped almonds, cashews, pistachios and raisins for crunch and sweetness. Toasting nuts in a little ghee before adding enhances their taste.
- Heat fifteen ml ghee in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker.
- Keep heat to low or medium-low and add the cup dalia (cracked wheat or broken wheat).
- Mix it with the ghee and on a low to medium-low heat, roast/toast the cracked wheat in ghee.
- Stir continuously while roasting/toasting.
- Roast/toast for 3 to 4 minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The cracked wheat will become aromatic and its color will change.
- Next add 1.5 to 1.eighteen thousand ml water. If using a large cooker add more water. Stir and mix very well.
- On a medium heat pressure cook for about 5 to 6 whistles or 5 to 6 minutes.

- Ensure the cracked wheat has nicely softened and cooked well.
- Next add milk and sugar to the cooked cracked wheat in the pressure cooker.
- Mix thoroughly and keep the cooker on the stovetop on a low to medium-low heat, uncovered.
- Let the mixture come to a simmer and a gentle boil. Stir at times.
- Simmer for 8 to 9 minutes uncovered. Make sure to stir often so that the cracked wheat does not stick to the bottom of the cooker. Check the taste and add more sugar if needed.
- For a slightly thin Sweet Dalia, you can also add more milk.
- Next add the cardamom powder, followed by chopped almonds and cashews.
- Mix well and simmer Milk Dalia for a minute or two.

424,Ragi Dosa Recipe | Nachni Dosa,,"prep_step:
- Batter: You can also mix the ragi flour in one hundred and twenty ml water (preferably warm) in a separate bowl. Then, add this ragi batter to dosa batter. There would be no lump formation this way and also less strain while mixing.
- Rice and Lentils: Easily swap the parboiled rice or idli recipe with any short-grained or medium-grained Indian variety of rice – parmal, sona masuri, ponni, kolam etc. You could also use idli rava. Soak about two hundred and forty g of idli rava in water for 4 hours. Drain all the water very well from the idli rava and later grind it. Preferably use unpolished hulled urad dal – they can be whole or split.
- Fermentation: The time taken for the batter to ferment will depend on the temperature and weather conditions of your city. If you have colder climate, add salt after the batter is fermented. If you are in hot climate, add salt before you keep the batter for fermentation.
- If batter doesn’t ferment well: If the batter doesn’t increase in volume after fermentation, then just add about one and one-quarter g baking soda, mix well and process to make dosa or idli. Alternatively opt to keep the batter for some more time for it to ferment well.
- Quality: Make sure to use good quality ingredients which are in their shelf life. Ragi flour gets rancid quickly and can get an off smell and a bitter taste. Use ragi flour that is within its shelf life. Do a taste test of the ragi flour and it should not taste bitter.
- In a bowl, rinse both the rice and poha. Then soak the rice with poha for 3 to 4 hours.
- In another bowl, rinse and soak the urad dal with the fenugreek seeds for 3 to 4 hours.
- Drain the rice and poha of all the water. Then in a wet grinder, first grind the rice and poha, adding about one hundred and eighty ml water to a fine and smooth consistency. A fine granular consistency is also fine.
- Pour the rice batter in a deep bowl. Remove the batter clinging at the sides with a spatula and add in the bowl.
- Drain the urad dal. Then in the same grinder grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a smooth and fluffy batter. Add one hundred and twenty ml water in parts while grinding the urad dal.
- Pour the urad dal batter in the same deep bowl. Mix well.
- Add the ragi flour and one-third to one hundred and twenty ml water. Again mix very well and thoroughly. There should be no lumps in the batter.
- Stir in salt. Close the bowl with a lid. Not airtight but just kept over it.
- Keep the ragi dosa batter in a warm place for 8 to 9 hours or more till the batter doubles up and is well fermented.
- If the batter does not increase in volume, then add 1.5 to thirty ml of yogurt and one and one-quarter g of baking soda in the batter. Stir and let it sit for some 30 minutes more and then proceed making with the dosa or idli.
- Heat a cast iron skillet or tawa or a nonstick pan. Dip half of an onion in oil and smear the oil on the iron tava or griddle. If using non stick pan, then don't smear oil.
- Pour a ladle of the batter and quickly spread it with the help of ladle in a circular motion.
- Let the one side cook. Drizzle with one-half to five ml oil on the top and sides.
- Flip and cook the other side of dosa till crisp and browned.
- Instead of cooking the ragi dosa on both sides, you can just cook one side.
- For cooking only on once side, after spreading the dosa batter on the hot tava, sprinkle oil on sides and top.
- Cover the dosa with a lid and cook till the base gets golden and the top is also cooked.
- Using the batter, make ragi dosa in batches this way. Regulate the stovetop heat as needed when making the dosa.
- Remove and serve the ragi dosa hot with coconut chutney and vegetable sambar.

425,Ragi Idli Recipe,,"prep_step:
- In a bowl, rinse the rice a couple of times. Then add 1 to 1.one thousand two hundred ml water and set aside.
- Rinse sixty g thick poha once or twice and add to the rice. Mix well. Cover and keep aside for 4 to 5 hours.
- In another bowl take urad dal and fenugreek seeds. Rinse for a couple of times and soak both the urad dal with the fenugreek seeds in two hundred and forty ml water for 4 to 5 hours.
- After 4 to 5 hours, drain the urad dal and add in a grinder jar.
- Grind the urad dal and methi seeds till you get a smooth and fluffy batter. Add water in parts while grinding. I used a total of one hundred and twenty ml water for grinding the urad dal. Take the urad dal batter in a bowl or pan.
- Next drain the rice & poha and add them to the same grinder jar. Depending on your jar capacity, you can grind the rice in two to three batches. For the first round I added one hundred and twenty ml water and for the next round I added sixty ml water. So overall I added one hundred and eighty ml water for grinding rice.
- Grind the rice grains till smooth or a fine granular consistency in the batter is also fine.
- Pour the rice batter in the same bowl having the urad dal batter.
- Mix both the batters very well.
- Now add two hundred and forty g ragi flour and one hundred and twenty ml water. You can adjust the water amount here depending on the consistency of the batter.
- Mix very well with a spoon or with your hands. Break the lumps if any. Mix to a smooth batter. A bit of handwork is required while mixing the ragi flour with the idli batter.
- Cover the bowl or pan with a lid and let it ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours or more depending on the temperature conditions in your city. The batter will increase in volume and double up.
- If the batter does not increase in volume, then just add one and one-quarter g baking soda in the batter. Mix very well and then proceed to steaming the ragi idli.
- Add salt and mix very well. I added salt the next day due to it being a cold season here. In a warmer climate, add salt before you keep the batter for fermentation.
- Grease the idli moulds with oil. Pour the batter in the idli moulds.
- Before placing the idli stand, add 2 to 2.one thousand two hundred ml water in an electric cooker or steamer or pressure cooker. Bring this water to a boil.
- Then place the idli stand in the hot water. For an electric cooker and steamer cover with its lid and steam. For pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the cooker and secure the lid tightly on the cooker.
- Steam ragi idli for 12 to 15 minutes. Depending on the equipment you have used, it may takes less or more time.
- A tooth pick inserted in the center of the ragi idlis should come out clean and not be sticky. Allow a standing time of 1 to 2 minutes.
- You can steam the ragi idli in batches. The leftover batter can be refrigerated and you can make dosa or uttapam.
- Dip a spoon or butter knife in water and slid them through the idlis. Remove and place the ragi idli in a warm container like a casserole.
- Serve ragi idli with coconut chutney and veg sambar.
- For kids you can also serve with a mix of thin coconut milk and jaggery. Simply dissolve the jaggery with thin coconut milk and serve with the nachni idli. For flavor you can add some cardamom powder to this solution.
- If the batter becomes thin, you can add a few tablespoons of ragi flour. If it is thick, then add some water.
- Instead of directly mixing the ragi flour with the urad dal and rice batter, you could first mix it with water first and add this ragi slurry or paste to the rice and lentil batter. Or you could blend the ragi flour after grinding the rice grains in the blender or mixer-grinder itself, adding water as needed.
- Fermentation depends on the temperature and climate. If you live in a cool or cold place, let the batter ferment for more time.

426,Ragi Malt | Healthy Ragi Java | Ragi Porridge,,"prep_step:
- Ragi malt can be made both sweet and savory. In this recipe post, I am sharing the sweet ragi malt recipe. For sweetness I have added jaggery. However sugar or any other sweetener of your choice can also be added instead of jaggery. Just avoid adding honey as it should not be heated.

427,Sabudana Khichdi Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Rinsing Sago: Rinse the sabudana pearls in a colander, under running water, very well until you feel that all the starch is rinsed and washed away. This thorough rinsing aids to clear out the excess starch that causes the sabudana khichdi to become lumpy, mushy and sticky.
- Soaking Sago: Transfer the washed and drained sabudana in a bowl. Add water with its level just above 1 to 1.5 inches in the bowl. Cover the bowl and leave the sabudana pearls for 3 to 4 hours or overnight. The time duration will depend on the quality of sabudana pearls.
- Sabudana Quality: Depending on the quality of sabudana, it can take less or more hours for soaking or will require less or more water. Before cooking, check the soaked sabudana. Press a few pearls. They should mash easily.
- Sabudana not soaked well: If you feel some hardness in the center, add few tablespoons water and leave for 30 minutes more. If the sabudana is not soaked properly and the center is hard, it won’t cook well. For a good texture and taste, the soaked sabudana has to be softened well.
- Straining soaked sabudana: Using a colander or sieve, strain the water from the sabudana well. Excess moisture can make the khichdi mushy, sticky, lumpy and pasty.
- Pan Type: Use a well-seasoned, thick bottomed and heavy frying pan or wok to make this dish. A light weight or a non-seasoned pan may lead to the sabudana sticking to the pan and even getting browned.
- Scaling: You can easily halve or double this Sago Khichdi Recipe.
- Cooking Potatoes: Potatoes can be boiled, steamed or fried before adding to the khichdi. I always boil them and sometimes I shallow fry them separately. Take care to cook them until fork tender only.
- Fats: You can use peanut oil or ghee to cook sabudana khichdi. Or opt to use the fat of your choice or the one which you usually use to cook your fasting or vrat food.
- Cooking sabudana: Remember not to overcook sabudana, as it can become dry, chewy and dense. It should have a nice softness after being cooked.
- Herbs and Spices: Green chillies and coriander leaves can be skipped. Feel free to include or exclude the spices or herbs that you generally use during the fasting.
- Salt: If making the khichdi for fasting days, add edible rock salt (sendha namak) in the khichdi. For non-fasting days, you can add regular salt.
- Rinse sabudana very well in water. Then soak sabudana overnight or for 3 to 5 hours.
- After the sabudana has soaked well enough, check if they have become soft or not.
- To do this take a few pearls and press them with your fingers. They should get mashed easily. If you feel some hardness in the center of the sabudana pearls, then add a few tablespoons of water in the bowl. Cover and leave to soak for 30 minutes more.
- Drain the soaked sabudana very well of all the water and set aside.
- Boil the potatoes and when warm peel and chop them.
- In a pan, dry roast the peanuts till browned and when cooled make a coarse powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder.
- Mix the coarsely powdered peanuts, salt and sugar with the drained sabudana.
- Now heat peanut oil or ghee. Fry the cumin first till they crackle and get browned on low to medium-low heat.
- Now add the curry leaves if using and green chillies. Fry for a few seconds and then add the grated ginger if using. Both curry leaves and ginger are optional and can be skipped.
- Saute for a couple of seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger goes away. Now add chopped boiled potatoes and saute for a minute.
- Add the sabudana. Keep on stirring often on a low heat for about 3 to 5 minutes.
- When the sabudana loses their opaqueness and starts becoming translucent they are cooked.
- Don’t overcook as they might become lumpy and hard.
- Turn off the heat and add lemon juice and chopped coriander leaves. Mix well.
- While serving garnish with a few coriander leaves and drizzle with some lemon juice. You can even add some grated fresh coconut on top.
- Serve Sabudana Khichdi hot or warm as is. Or you can serve with a side of sweetened curd or a satvik coconut chutney made with fasting ingredients.
- Rinse the sabudana pearls very well in water to get rid of excess starch.
- Depending on the quality of sabudana you soak them in less or more water or for less or more time. If the sabudana is not soaked properly and if the center is hard then it won’t cook well. For a good texture and taste in the khichdi, the soaked sabudana has to be softened really well.
- After the sabudana pearls are soaked well, drain all the water very well. If there is any water left then this sago khichdi will become pasty or mushy.
- Potatoes can be boiled, steamed or fried and then added to sabudana khichdi. I generally boil or steam the potatoes and sometimes fry them.
- You can skip green chilies and coriander leaves if you want.
- For Hindu fasting during Ekadashi, Navratri, Mahashivratri, please add edible rock salt ( sendha namak ) in the sabudana khichdi.
- The recipe can be halved or doubled easily.

quick_step:
- Rinsing Sago: Rinse the sabudana pearls in a colander, under running water, very well until you feel that all the starch is rinsed and washed away. This thorough rinsing aids to clear out the excess starch that causes the sabudana khichdi to become lumpy, mushy and sticky.
- Soaking Sago: Transfer the washed and drained sabudana in a bowl. Add water with its level just above 1 to 1.5 inches in the bowl. Cover the bowl and leave the sabudana pearls for 3 to 4 hours or overnight. The time duration will depend on the quality of sabudana pearls.
- Sabudana Quality: Depending on the quality of sabudana, it can take less or more hours for soaking or will require less or more water. Before cooking, check the soaked sabudana. Press a few pearls. They should mash easily.
- Sabudana not soaked well: If you feel some hardness in the center, add few tablespoons water and leave for 30 minutes more. If the sabudana is not soaked properly and the center is hard, it won’t cook well. For a good texture and taste, the soaked sabudana has to be softened well.
- Straining soaked sabudana: Using a colander or sieve, strain the water from the sabudana well. Excess moisture can make the khichdi mushy, sticky, lumpy and pasty.

- Pan Type: Use a well-seasoned, thick bottomed and heavy frying pan or wok to make this dish. A light weight or a non-seasoned pan may lead to the sabudana sticking to the pan and even getting browned.
- Scaling: You can easily halve or double this Sago Khichdi Recipe.
- Cooking Potatoes: Potatoes can be boiled, steamed or fried before adding to the khichdi. I always boil them and sometimes I shallow fry them separately. Take care to cook them until fork tender only.
- Fats: You can use peanut oil or ghee to cook sabudana khichdi. Or opt to use the fat of your choice or the one which you usually use to cook your fasting or vrat food.
- Cooking sabudana: Remember not to overcook sabudana, as it can become dry, chewy and dense. It should have a nice softness after being cooked.
- Herbs and Spices: Green chillies and coriander leaves can be skipped. Feel free to include or exclude the spices or herbs that you generally use during the fasting.
- Salt: If making the khichdi for fasting days, add edible rock salt (sendha namak) in the khichdi. For non-fasting days, you can add regular salt.
- Rinse sabudana very well in water. Then soak sabudana overnight or for 3 to 5 hours.
- After the sabudana has soaked well enough, check if they have become soft or not.
- To do this take a few pearls and press them with your fingers. They should get mashed easily. If you feel some hardness in the center of the sabudana pearls, then add a few tablespoons of water in the bowl. Cover and leave to soak for 30 minutes more.
- Drain the soaked sabudana very well of all the water and set aside.
- Boil the potatoes and when warm peel and chop them.
- In a pan, dry roast the peanuts till browned and when cooled make a coarse powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder.
- Mix the coarsely powdered peanuts, salt and sugar with the drained sabudana.
- Now heat peanut oil or ghee. Fry the cumin first till they crackle and get browned on low to medium-low heat.
- Now add the curry leaves if using and green chillies. Fry for a few seconds and then add the grated ginger if using. Both curry leaves and ginger are optional and can be skipped.
- Saute for a couple of seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger goes away. Now add chopped boiled potatoes and saute for a minute.
- Add the sabudana. Keep on stirring often on a low heat for about 3 to 5 minutes.
- When the sabudana loses their opaqueness and starts becoming translucent they are cooked.
- Don’t overcook as they might become lumpy and hard.
- Turn off the heat and add lemon juice and chopped coriander leaves. Mix well.
- While serving garnish with a few coriander leaves and drizzle with some lemon juice. You can even add some grated fresh coconut on top.
- Serve Sabudana Khichdi hot or warm as is. Or you can serve with a side of sweetened curd or a satvik coconut chutney made with fasting ingredients.
- Rinse the sabudana pearls very well in water to get rid of excess starch.
- Depending on the quality of sabudana you soak them in less or more water or for less or more time. If the sabudana is not soaked properly and if the center is hard then it won’t cook well. For a good texture and taste in the khichdi, the soaked sabudana has to be softened really well.
- After the sabudana pearls are soaked well, drain all the water very well. If there is any water left then this sago khichdi will become pasty or mushy.
- Potatoes can be boiled, steamed or fried and then added to sabudana khichdi. I generally boil or steam the potatoes and sometimes fry them.
- You can skip green chilies and coriander leaves if you want.
- For Hindu fasting during Ekadashi, Navratri, Mahashivratri, please add edible rock salt ( sendha namak ) in the sabudana khichdi.

428,Sabudana Vada Recipe (For Fasting),,"prep_step:
- With Sweet Potato: Swap potatoes with sweet potatoes and make a sweet tasting sago vada. Boil or steam the sweet potatoes first in enough water. Once tender and softened, let them cool. Later peel and mash before mixing it with the other ingredients.
- With Onions: Normally onions and garlic and never added in the traditional sabudana vada recipe. If you are willing to experiment, you can add onions or garlic to the vada dough mixture.
- Nuts: An authentic and traditional sabudana vada recipe always features peanuts. If you do not have peanuts, make the vada without them or swap with cashews. Some fresh grated coconut (about thirty g) can be added to the vada mixture.
- Herbs: Feel free to omit coriander leaves in this sago vada recipe. You can replace coriander with about fifteen g of mint leaves or add about fifteen g of chopped curry leaves. Note that the taste and flavor will change with either mint or curry leaves.
- Spices: The only spice that gives some heat and pungency in the sabudana vada recipe are green chillies. Opt to add some crushed black pepper (about two and one-half g) instead of green chillies. For a spicy taste and when not making for the fasting time, add one-half to five g of red chilli powder or cayenne pepper.
- Scaling: According to your needs, you can easily halve, double or triple this sabudana vada recipe.
- You need to plan ahead and soak the sago pearls. It is very important to soak the sago really well. Important: Please refrain from using un-soaked or under-soaked sabudana to avoid scalding or burns as they will burst and shatter in oil when frying.
- First optionally, using a colander or mesh strainer rinse two hundred and forty g sabudana lightly twice draining all the water.
- Soak the sabudana or sago in water for 5 hours at least or overnight. I soaked the sago pearls overnight and by morning they had become soft.
- When properly soaked, the sabudana pearls will be tender without any hard center. When you press the pearls between your forefinger and thumb, they should get mashed easily with a floury moist texture on your fingers.
- If you feel some hardness in the center, then soak for some more time. Drain all the water really well from the soaked sabudana.
- There should not be any water logged in the soaked pearls. Water will make the patties moist and sticky. The patties will soak up a good amount of oil while frying making them loaded with oil. So drain the water really well.
- You can opt to gently and lightly press the soaked pearls in the strainer with a spoon or spatula. Or set aside the pearls in a strainer (keeping a bowl beneath) for some 20 to 30 minutes dripping of any extra water.
- After draining the water thoroughly transfer the sabudana in a mixing bowl and set aside.
- Scrub and rinse 4 medium-sized potatoes thoroughly in water first.
- Let the potatoes become warm. Later peel and then chop them or mash them.
- On a skillet or in a shallow pan, roast the groundnuts/peanuts till they become crisp and crunchy.
- Cool and then coarsely powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder. You can even make a fine powder.
- Add the mashed potatoes and coarsely ground roasted groundnuts to the sabudana in the mixing bowl.
- Add edible rock salt, cumin seeds, sugar, ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves and lemon juice to the sabudana . Mix the entire mixture very well.
- Now take some portion of the mixture in your hands and shape them into flat round vada or patty. Set aside.
- Repeat until you use up the entire dough mixture.
- Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai. Add a tiny ball made from the mixture.
- Fry it on medium flame. If this ball does not break while frying, then you are good to go.
- If it breaks, then add 1 to thirty g of rajgira atta (or amaranth flour) to the mixture and mix well.
- Now gently place the vada in the oil. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high while frying. If the oil is warm, the vada will absorb a lot of oil and become soggy.
- Add the vada for frying depending on the size of the kadai. Do not crowd the kadai or pan.
- When one side gets golden, then only flip the vada. Otherwise, don't even touch as they might break if not cooked.
- Turn over a couple of times so as to fry the sabudana vada evenly. Fry until they are crisp and golden
- Remove them with a slotted spoon. Place on kitchen paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry the remaining batches of the patties this way.
- Serve Sabudana Vada hot or warm.
- Sabudana Vada can be made for fasting days or as an evening snack.
- It pairs well with coconut chutney, sweetened curd (just mix in some sugar), coriander chutney, tamarind chutney, or even tomato ketchup.
- For prep ahead, boil and mash potatoes a day earlier, and roast and powder peanuts.
- Soaked sabudana can also be refrigerated after draining water.
- The patties can be shaped in advance and kept in the fridge. Any leftover mixture keeps well in the fridge for 1 to 2 days.

430,Paneer Paratha Recipe (Punjabi Style),,"prep_step:
- Dough Softness: Make sure to knead a pliable, soft and smooth dough for this Paneer Paratha Recipe. Depending on the quality and texture of flour, add water as needed to get a soft dough.
- Paneer Quality: For best results, ensure using homemade paneer or soft, fresh and moist paneer. Discard the paneer, if it has turned rancid.
- Grating Paneer: It is better to grate the paneer and not crumble it with hands. As grating will result in even sized paneer versus the uneven, bigger pieces of paneer when crumbled.
- Adjusting Spices: You can add more or less spices and seasonings as per your palate preferences. Make sure to chop the green chilies finely or else they can come out while rolling the parathas.
- Using Garam Masala Powder: If you are using homemade garam masala powder that is stronger and more aromatic, then add just one and one-quarter g of it. For readymade garam masala powder, use two and one-half g.
- Variations: Some finely chopped onions and finely chopped coriander or mint leaves can also be added in the paneer stuffing for a nice, crunchy and fresh variation.
- Stuffing Paratha: While stuffing the paneer paratha, make sure not to overfill or under-fill. Overfilling can lead to the stuffing coming out while rolling. Whereas, you won’t get the proper taste of the paneer mixture if you under-fill.
- Choice of Fats: Any neutral flavored oil or ghee (clarified butter) can be used to roast the parathas.
- Scaling Recipe: This paneer paratha recipe can easily halved, doubled or tripled to make for smaller or larger portions.

- Dust some flour on the dough balls.
- With a rolling pin, roll the dough balls to a circle of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.
- Place the paneer stuffing on one of the rolled rounds keeping one inch space around the circumference.
- Cover with the other rolled dough and press the edges well.
- Sprinkle some flour and roll the stuffed paratha to a circle of about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.
- Heat a tawa or griddle and then place the rolled paratha on it. The tawa should be hot. You can use medium-high to high heat.
- To check the heat, sprinkle a generous pinch of whole wheat flour on the tawa. If the whole wheat flour becomes brown in some seconds, the tawa is hot enough to roast the parathas.
- Flip when one side is partly cooked. About one-quarter cooked. This takes about 1 minute or so.
- Apply ghee on this side with a spoon. Turn over and flip when the second side is half cooked, which takes about 1one-half minute or so.
- Let the ghee side get cooked now. Spread some ghee on the top. Flip again using a spatula.
- Press the paratha edges with a spatula so that the edges are cooked.

432,Methi Paratha Recipe (Punjabi Methi ke Parathe),,"prep_step:
- Mix some salt with the rinsed fenugreek leaves. Set aside for 15 to 20 minutes.  Rinse the leaves a few times and drain the water.
- Blanch the methi leaves in boiling salted water for about a minute. Drain, rinse with fresh water, and use.
- Place the fenugreek leaves in a bowl filled with water and to which two and one-half g baking soda and fifteen ml vinegar has been added.
- Soak for about 2 to 3 minutes, later draining all the water.
- Soak the leaves in clean water for a couple of minutes. Swish and move the leaves gently with your fingers. This removes any soil or mud particles that are on the stems or leaves.
- Drain the water again. You can repeat this process of soaking and draining once or twice or choose to thoroughly rinse the leaves under running water for a few times. Finally, drain the water well.
- Place the leaves on a kitchen towel and spread them evenly on it for a few minutes or you can proceed to chopping them.
- In a bowl mix the whole wheat flour and salt.
- Add the chopped methi leaves, green chilies, garlic, oil and mix again.
- Pour water little by little and mix the dough first. Later knead to a smooth and soft dough adding water as needed.
- Note that the water proportion will vary with the water content in the fenugreek leaves and the type, variety of wheat flour.
- Tip 1: If the dough looks sticky, add a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour and knead again.
- Tip 2: If the dough looks dry or dense, add a couple of tablespoons of water and continue to knead.
- Flatten the dough ball and dust it lightly with some flour and the rolling board as well.
- With a rolling pin, roll the dough into medium sized roti or circle having 7 to 8 inches diameter.
- For a flaky, crispy layered paratha, spread ghee all over and fold twice into a triangle shape. Then roll them to a large triangle shaped dough sprinkling flour lightly.
- The layering method with ghee adds more fat in your parathas, but if you want a simple lighter version, then roll them plain with brushing any ghee on the dough as done in this recipe.
- Heat a skillet or tawa on medium-high to high heat. Place the rolled methi paratha on a hot tawa or griddle.
- Tip: To check the hotness of the skillet, sprinkle a pinch of flour on it. If the flour browns in a few seconds, the skillet is hot enough for roasting paratha. Wipe this roasted flour on the skillet with a kitchen napkin before placing the paratha on it.
- When one side is a bit cooked or about one-quarter cooked, flip the paratha. You will see some air pockets beginning to form on paratha.
- Spread some oil or ghee (clarified butter) on the side that is facing you.
- Flip again and you should see some brown or golden spots on the paratha. Spread ghee on this side having the golden spots.
- Flip again a couple of times, until the paratha is evenly roasted and has some golden spots or blisters. Press the paratha edges with a spatula so that they get cooked.
- Roll the remaining dough balls and make the methi parathas this way. While making the second paratha don’t forget to wipe the skillet with a kitchen napkin if there is any excess whole wheat flour on it.
- Methi paratha is best served hot. However, it can be served warm or at room temperature. You can also stack them in a roti basket or casserole box/container.
- Easily enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or at dinner. My favorite things to serve with methi ke parathe are vegetable curries, sweetened curd, or pickle.
- Some people like to have parathas with plain curd (yogurt), mango pickle, lemon pickle, or green chili pickle. It all depends on your preference!
- They can also be wrapped in foil and packed in lunch boxes or for short journeys. Methi roti make a good tiffin box snack and stay soft when packed in a foil.

433,Onion Paratha (Stuffed Onion Flatbread),,"prep_step:
- Onions: Include any variety of onions like white, red or yellow. My preference is always for red onions as I feel they give the best taste to the paratha. You could also use shallots or pearl onions. Keep in mind that the onions have to be finely chopped. If not, then you won’t be able to roll the paratha easily as it will tear while rolling.
- Variations: As a variation you can add some chopped coriander (cilantro leaves) or mint leaves to the stuffing. Mix the herbs with onions and set aside before filling in paratha. Another variation which changes the flavor completely is adding carom seeds (ajwain). Sometimes I add this fragrant spice in the filling. Just sprinkle a pinch or two on top of the onions while sprinkling the garam masala etc.
- Spicing: If you cannot tolerate spicy food, than reduce or omit the green chillies and red chilli powder. If making pyaz paratha for small kids, skip the green chilies and all the ground spice powders.
- Tanginess: For a tangy taste in your onion paratha recipe, lightly sprinkle some amchur powder (dry mango powder) or chaat masala on the onions.
- Dough: Make sure to knead the dough until soft, supple and smooth. If the dough is not soft, it will make your parathas dense and chewy. If the dough is very loose or sticky, it will be difficult to stuff and roll the paratha.
- Roasting: Roast the paratha on a hot skillet. The heat can be from medium-high to high. If the skillet is cold, it will make the parathas hard or chewy. If the skillet becomes too hot, the paratha will burn or get cooked quickly, leaving the inside stuffing raw or undercooked.
- Mix the flour with the salt. Add the oil or ghee and a bit of water.
- Begin to knead the dough adding water as needed. Knead to a smooth and soft dough.
- Cover and keep aside the dough for 20 to 30  minutes.
- As the dough is resting we prepare the filling.
- Finely chop the onions & green chilies. If the onions and green chillies are not finely chopped then they will pop out of the paratha while rolling or roasting. So do remember to finely chop them.
- Mix them together and set aside.
- Make medium sized balls from the dough.
- Take a ball and roll into 3 to 4 inch diameter disc on a dusted board.
- Add the finely chopped onions-chilies mixture in the center.
- Sprinkle one or two pinch of garam masala powder, red chili powder and salt.
- Bring together all the edges of the dough.
- Join them in the center and press downwards.
- Sprinkle some more flour and roll into a paratha of about 6 to 8 inches in diameter.
- Heat a tawa or griddle or skillet before you start rolling the paratha. Keep the flame to medium-high or high. Once the tawa becomes hot then place the rolled onion paratha on it.
- Fry the paratha on a hot tava drizzling about 1 or ten ml of ghee or oil (or as required) on both sides till the paratha is evenly cooked and browned. Make sure that the paratha edges are also cooked well. You can press the edges with a spatula for even cooking.
- Serve onion paratha hot with some mango pickle, yogurt (dairy or vegan) or a side vegetable dish.
- These parathas taste so good that they can be had as is with Indian chai. They can also be packed in a tiffin box.
- The onions and green chillies have to be finely chopped. If not, then you won’t be able to roll the parathas.
- As a variation some chopped coriander (cilantro leaves) can also be added to the stuffing.

- If making onion paratha for kids, then skip the green chilies and the spice powders.
- For a tangy taste, sprinkle some amchur powder (dry mango powder) or chaat masala on the onions.
- Knead the dough very well. It has to be soft, smooth and pliable. The paratha will become hard or dense if the dough is not soft. If the dough becomes very loose or sticky, it will not be easy to stuff and roll the paratha.
- Roast the paratha on a hot skillet. The heat can be from medium-high to high. If the skillet is cold, it will make the parathas hard. If the skillet becomes too hot, the paratha will burn or get cooked quickly, leaving the inside stuffing raw or undercooked.

435,Baingan Bharta Recipe (Smoky Indian Mashed Eggplant),,"prep_step:
- Picking the right eggplant: Use the large dark purple variety with smooth skin. It should feel light as light brinjals have fewer seeds. Avoid any with cracks or holes, which may indicate worms.
- Fire roasting eggplant: Roasting on a direct flame gives the best smoky flavor. Turn the brinjal every few minutes for even cooking. To check doneness, pierce a knife or fork—if it slides through easily, it’s cooked.
- Best way to roast eggplant: Rinse and pat dry the eggplant. Keep the stem for easy handling. Give a cross slit and check for worms. Roast on medium flame, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Optionally rub oil on the skin and embed garlic cloves for added flavor.
- Roasting in the oven: Preheat oven to 180°C for 10 mins. Cut eggplant in halves or keep whole with slits. Line a tray with foil or parchment, place eggplant cut side down, and roast for 25–35 mins until soft. Note that there is no smoky flavor in oven roasting.
- Cooking in a pan: Chop eggplant, cook with water until soft, then drain and mash. You can add salt while cooking. This method won’t give a smoky taste in the baingan bharta.
- Checking for worms: Even with slits, worms may be missed. If you find one after roasting, discard the pulp. As an alternative, chop and cook in a pan or roast in the oven.
- Rinse the eggplant in water and then pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.
- Cut on four sides or directions as shown in the step-by-step guide above. The eggplant has to be whole when you place it on the stove-top.
- Pull apart the cut sides gently and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it.
- If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, then proceed further. Optionally you can spread a light layer of oil all over it.
- Keep it for roasting on direct flame on the stove-top. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.
- Note that as the eggplant cooks some of the juices and drippings will fall which you can wipe later. I don’t recommend placing or covering the sides of the stove-top burner with aluminum foil as they can burn and be dangerous.
- You can also grill the eggplant in the oven. But then do note that you won’t get the smoky flavor in the eggplant.
- Secure the eggplant between tongs and keep on turning it after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.
- Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a fork or knife check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in aubergine without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.
- You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the eggplant. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Carefully heat a small piece of charcoal on flame with the help of tongs or by placing it in a wired metal fire-proof rack above the flame, till it becomes smoking hot and red.
- Make small cuts on the roasted eggplant with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.
- As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
- Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.
- Whether you have charcoal smoked the eggplant or not, peel the charred skin when it cools. Chop finely or you can even mash it.
- In a kadai or frying pan or skillet, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.
- Stirring often, sauté the onions till they soften and translucent. Don't brown them.
- Add chopped green chillies and chopped tomatoes. Mix well.
- Sauté the tomatoes stirring often, till the oil starts separating from the mixture.
- The tomatoes should become pulpy, soft and oil should release from the masala mixture.
- Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix again.
- Add the chopped or mashed eggplant. Mix thoroughly.
- Season with salt. Stirring often saute for some 4 to 5 minutes on low to medium-low heat.
- Finally stir in the coriander leaves or garnish bharta with them. Serve baingan bharta with phulka, roti or chapati. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.
- You can also pair it with any North Indian meal or mains.

quick_step:
- Picking the right eggplant: Use the large dark purple variety with smooth skin. It should feel light as light brinjals have fewer seeds. Avoid any with cracks or holes, which may indicate worms.
- Fire roasting eggplant: Roasting on a direct flame gives the best smoky flavor. Turn the brinjal every few minutes for even cooking. To check doneness, pierce a knife or fork—if it slides through easily, it’s cooked.
- Best way to roast eggplant: Rinse and pat dry the eggplant. Keep the stem for easy handling. Give a cross slit and check for worms. Roast on medium flame, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Optionally rub oil on the skin and embed garlic cloves for added flavor.
- Roasting in the oven: Preheat oven to 180°C for 10 mins. Cut eggplant in halves or keep whole with slits. Line a tray with foil or parchment, place eggplant cut side down, and roast for 25–35 mins until soft. Note that there is no smoky flavor in oven roasting.
- Cooking in a pan: Chop eggplant, cook with water until soft, then drain and mash. You can add salt while cooking. This method won’t give a smoky taste in the baingan bharta.

439,Pinwheel Sandwich Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Flatten the bread slices by gently rolling them with a rolling pin.
- Trim the edges of the bread slices.
- Place the bread slices on a sheet of cling film, slightly overlapping so they form a long rectangle.
- Moisten the overlapping edges with a little water and press them gently so they stick well.
- Note that the edges should not be dry, or the slices will separate and the roll may break while rolling. At the same time, avoid making them too wet or soggy, as overly moist bread can tear. Make sure the slices hold together firmly before you start adding the fillings.
- Mash the avocado in a small bowl and mix the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Keep it aside.
- In another bowl, add softened cream cheese.
- Add chopped coriander or parsley and celery. Mix well. Add a little mayonnaise if you prefer extra creaminess.
- Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the entire bread sheet.
- Then spread the mashed avocado layer on top.
- Place the lettuce (if using), grated carrot, tomato slices, cucumber slices, sliced olives and basil evenly across the bread.
- Add the grated cheddar cheese and sprinkle a little salt, pepper, chili flakes if using and dried mixed herbs.
- Use the cling film to help you roll the bread tightly into a log. Wrap it completely in the cling film and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour so it sets well.
- Remove the cling film and slice the roll into neat pinwheels using a serrated knife.
- Serve the pinwheel sandwiches chilled or at room temperature.
- They pair well with pesto, guacamole, or a simple herb mayo. A little ketchup also works if you’re serving kids.
- Keep the rolled log wrapped in cling film in the refrigerator and slice just before serving. Since the filling contains tomatoes, serve within an hour for the best texture.
- Once sliced, store leftovers in an airtight container and finish the same day. Avoid freezing as the bread becomes dry.

442,Bread Pakora Recipe (Stuffed Bread Pakoda),,"prep_step:
- Batter: Since carom seeds (ajwain) impart a nice aroma and also aid digestion, I always add them and a few spices to the batter. Other ingredients that you can include in the batter are chopped/grated ginger and asafoetida (hing). These also help in digestion.
- Stuffing: My recipe of Bread Pakora has warm, aromatic spices, typical of the Punjabi food cuisine. It also makes for tangy, spiced pakoras. Moreover, you save time as you don’t have to spend any time in sautéing or frying anything. You can simply mix the spice powders with the mashed potatoes for the stuffing to be ready.
- Bread: This recipe can be made with your choice of bread. However, for best flavor, use White Bread . I have prepared these with homemade Whole Wheat Bread or Brown Bread , and it tastes just as good.
- Cooking potatoes in a stove-top pressure cooker Rinse and place 2 medium-sized potatoes in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Add enough water just about covering them. Pressure cook on a medium heat for 3 to 4 whistles or 7 to 9 minutes. Drain the water. Let the potatoes become warm. Peel, grate or mash.
- Cooking potatoes in a pan Rinse, peel and then dice potatoes. Add the chopped potatoes in a pan. Add water just enough to cover them. You can add a bit of salt. Cover and cook potatoes till they are softened. Later drain all the water very well. When the potatoes become warm then peel and grate them. You can even mash them.
- Cooking in the Instant Pot Rinse and place the potatoes in the inner pan of the Instant Pot. Add enough water just about covering the potatoes. Pressure cook on high for 8 to 10 minutes. Give a quick pressure release (QPR) after 5 to 7 minutes. Check to see if the potatoes are cooked. If underdone, then pressure cook for some more minutes. Remove the potatoes with pasta tongs. Let them become warm or cool at room temperature. Then peel and mash.
- Potatoes: Use potatoes which have a high starch content like Idaho or Russet potatoes. Avoid using potatoes which are new or have a gluey gummy texture.
- Spices and herbs: You can make a number of variations by adding different combinations of spices and herbs both in the besan batter and the potato stuffing. Fresh herbs like mint leaves, coriander leaves, ginger, garlic and spices like green chilies, cumin powder or coriander powder, red chili powder, black pepper powder, curry powder or garam masala powder can be added.
- Consistency of batter: Make a medium consistency batter. If the batter is thick, then the outer texture will be dense and not fluffy or soft. A thin batter will make the pakoda soggy by absorbing too much oil.
- Oily pakoda: To avoid oily pakoda, fry on medium heat. Do not fry on low heat as then the pakoda will absorb more oil. Frying on a high heat will cook and brown the pakoda from outside, leaving the insides raw and uncooked.
- Scaling: You can easily halve or double the recipe according to your needs.
- Make ahead: If you plan to make these pakoras for morning breakfasts or evening snacks, then you can make the potato stuffing some hours or a day ahead and refrigerate it.
- Drop tiny droplets of batter in oil. If the batter droplets sizzle, and rise to the top gradually, the oil is ready. If droplets are stuck at the bottom of the pan or comes up slowly on the surface the oil is not hot enough. If the batter droplets come up briskly, quickly on the oil surface and get browed rapidly, the oil is very hot.
- Place a small bread cube in the hot oil. If the bread cube turns golden in a time span of about 1 minute, the temperature is perfect for frying. If it gets burnt or turns very dark, the oil is extremely hot and needs to cool slightly. You will have to let the oil heat up more, if the cube is pale colored.
- Boil or steam the potatoes in a stovetop pressure cooker or a steamer, adding water as needed, until they are softened and fork tender.
- When the potatoes becomes warm, then peel them. Grate and keep aside. You can also mash the potatoes and keep aside.
- Add the chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves and green chillies, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, dry mango powder, salt to the grated potatoes.
- Mix the spices & herbs very well with the mashed potatoes. Check the seasonings and adjust accordingly. Set the mashed potato stuffing aside.
- In a bowl, take the besan (gram flour), carom seeds, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, asafoetida, baking soda (optional) and salt.
- Add about one hundred and twenty ml of water and mix thoroughly to make a smooth batter without any lumps.
- The batter should not be very thick nor too thin. If it is too thick, then add more water.
- Add 1 to ten g of hot oil when you keep the oil for deep frying in the batter. Mix well. Next, whisk briskly non-stop for 1 to 2 minutes to incorporate some air into the  batter.
- On the chopping board, slice the bread into triangle or rectangle slices.
- Take around 2 to forty five g of the mashed potato mixture and spread it on the bread evenly.
- Cover this potato stuffed slice with another slice. You now have a triangular bread sandwich. Just slightly press the sandwich.
- Take the entire sandwich in your hand and dip it in the gram flour batter.
- Coat the stuffed bread sandwich evenly with the besan batter. Be gentle with the sandwich. Take care not to keep the stuffed bread sandwich a long time in the gram flour batter as the bread can become soggy and fall apart.
- By now, your oil is hot and you can easily slid the besan batter coated bread sandwich in the oil.
- Fry on a medium heat till the bread pakora are crispy and golden.
- Place them on kitchen paper towels so that excess oil is absorbed.
- Serve bread pakoda hot or warm with tomato ketchup or with any green chutney of your choice, or even sweet tamarind chutney.

Give a quick pressure release (QPR) after 5 to 7 minutes. Check to see if the potatoes are cooked. If underdone, then pressure cook for some more minutes. Remove the potatoes with pasta tongs. Let them become warm or cool at room temperature. Then peel and mash.
- Potatoes: Use potatoes which have a high starch content like Idaho or Russet potatoes. Avoid using potatoes which are new or have a gluey gummy texture.
- Spices and herbs: You can make a number of variations by adding different combinations of spices and herbs both in the besan batter and the potato stuffing. Fresh herbs like mint leaves, coriander leaves, ginger, garlic and spices like green chilies, cumin powder or coriander powder, red chili powder, black pepper powder, curry powder or garam masala powder can be added.
- Consistency of batter: Make a medium consistency batter. If the batter is thick, then the outer texture will be dense and not fluffy or soft. A thin batter will make the pakoda soggy by absorbing too much oil.
- Oily pakoda: To avoid oily pakoda, fry on medium heat. Do not fry on low heat as then the pakoda will absorb more oil. Frying on a high heat will cook and brown the pakoda from outside, leaving the insides raw and uncooked.
- Scaling: You can easily halve or double the recipe according to your needs.
- Make ahead: If you plan to make these pakoras for morning breakfasts or evening snacks, then you can make the potato stuffing some hours or a day ahead and refrigerate it.
- Drop tiny droplets of batter in oil. If the batter droplets sizzle, and rise to the top gradually, the oil is ready. If droplets are stuck at the bottom of the pan or comes up slowly on the surface the oil is not hot enough. If the batter droplets come up briskly, quickly on the oil surface and get browed rapidly, the oil is very hot.
- Place a small bread cube in the hot oil. If the bread cube turns golden in a time span of about 1 minute, the temperature is perfect for frying. If it gets burnt or turns very dark, the oil is extremely hot and needs to cool slightly. You will have to let the oil heat up more, if the cube is pale colored.
- Boil or steam the potatoes in a stovetop pressure cooker or a steamer, adding water as needed, until they are softened and fork tender.
- When the potatoes becomes warm, then peel them. Grate and keep aside. You can also mash the potatoes and keep aside.
- Add the chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves and green chillies, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, dry mango powder, salt to the grated potatoes.
- Mix the spices & herbs very well with the mashed potatoes. Check the seasonings and adjust accordingly. Set the mashed potato stuffing aside.
- In a bowl, take the besan (gram flour), carom seeds, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, asafoetida, baking soda (optional) and salt.
- Add about one hundred and twenty ml of water and mix thoroughly to make a smooth batter without any lumps.
- The batter should not be very thick nor too thin. If it is too thick, then add more water.
- Add 1 to ten g of hot oil when you keep the oil for deep frying in the batter. Mix well. Next, whisk briskly non-stop for 1 to 2 minutes to incorporate some air into the  batter.
- On the chopping board, slice the bread into triangle or rectangle slices.
- Take around 2 to forty five g of the mashed potato mixture and spread it on the bread evenly.
- Cover this potato stuffed slice with another slice. You now have a triangular bread sandwich. Just slightly press the sandwich.
- Take the entire sandwich in your hand and dip it in the gram flour batter.
- Coat the stuffed bread sandwich evenly with the besan batter. Be gentle with the sandwich. Take care not to keep the stuffed bread sandwich a long time in the gram flour batter as the bread can become soggy and fall apart.
- By now, your oil is hot and you can easily slid the besan batter coated bread sandwich in the oil.
- Fry on a medium heat till the bread pakora are crispy and golden.
- Place them on kitchen paper towels so that excess oil is absorbed.
- Serve bread pakoda hot or warm with tomato ketchup or with any green chutney of your choice, or even sweet tamarind chutney.

449,Thepla Recipe (Multigrain Methi Thepla),,"prep_step:
- Lauki Thepla : I make these soft flatbreads with bottle gourd (opo squash, calabash). My lauki thepla recipe is different from methi thepla wherein I do not include millet flours but only add whole wheat flour and gram flour.
- Mooli Thepla : These rustic flatbreads made with tender white radish (mooli), whole wheat flour and spices are simply delicious. Both mooli thepla and mooli paratha are different unique recipes. To make mooli thepla mix the radish with the flour and then knead to a soft dough. But to make paratha, you stuff the grated radish as a separate layer in the rolled dough.
- Plain Thepla: Make the simplest version of plain thepla recipe without any vegetables. Omit fenugreek leaves in this recipe. Add some water to knead the dough. You can also omit the millet flours and include 1one hundred and twenty g of whole wheat flour and sixty g of gram flour.
- With Kasuri Methi: We call dried fenugreek leaves ‘Kasuri Methi’ in Hindi. These dried fragrant leaves come in handy when you do not have fresh leaves. You can replace fresh methi leaves with Kasuri Methi in this recipe – simply add about 2 to forty five g. Add some water as needed while kneading.
- Other Greens: You can make this thepla recipe with green leafy vegetables like spinach or amaranth leaves.
- Flours: You can include various combinations of flours with different ratios. However, always add more whole wheat flour. With lesser amounts of wheat flour, your flatbreads can become chewy or hard and you won’t be able to roll the dough easily. A relevant point to be remembered is not to increase the amount of gram flour (besan) too much. This can make the texture hard and dry.
- Dough Consistency: The dough has to be smooth, soft, and pliable. If your dough looks hard, the texture will become dry and hard. With a soft and sticky dough, you won’t be able to roll evenly and it may tear. To correct hard dough, add a few tablespoons of curd or water and knead. For a sticky dough, add some wheat flour.
- Longer Storage: If you want to make flatbreads for a journey or you plan to store it for some days. Then add about 3 to sixty ml of oil to the flour, while you form the dough. Not only adding oil will make the texture soft but also help in preserving them for some days. Omit to add the curd (yogurt) as it decreases the shelf life of these flatbreads.
- Spicing: For a spicy version add more green chilies and red chili powder. You can always add less or more ground spices and green chilies according to your preferences.
- Fats: For roasting thepla, you may use ghee (clarified butter) instead of oil.
- Rinse the methi leaves in running water a few times getting rid of any dirt or mud clinging on them. Then drain them really well and chop finely.
- In a mixing bowl, take whole wheat flour, gram flour, sorghum flour and pearl millet flour. I have used millet flours but you can skip them if you don't have. In this case, simply add 1.six thousand g whole wheat flour and one hundred and twenty g besan.
- Add all the ginger and green chilli paste, followed by the spice powders – red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder.
- Season with salt. Add fifteen ml oil.
- Add the finely chopped fenugreek leaves. Mix everything well.
- Add curd or yogurt. For a vegan option add very little water instead of curd.
- Mix again and knead into a dough. Don't add water while kneading as methi leaves will release water.
- Knead to a soft and smooth dough. Add more curd if needed while kneading.
- Make medium sized balls from the dough.
- Take a medium sized ball and sprinkle some flour on it.
- With the rolling pin begin to roll the dough to a round or disc of about 7 to 8 inches in diameter.
- On a hot tawa or skillet, place the rolled dough. Flip when one side is partly cooked, about one-fourth or half cooked. You will see some faint air pockets on the top and this is the time when you need to flip it.
- Spread oil on this side. Flip the thepla again when the second side is half-cooked.
- Now spread the oil on this side. Flip a couple of times till you get golden spots and the methi thepla is cooked evenly.
- You can also press the thepla with spatula while cooking.
- Remove and keep it in a roti basket.
- Serve Methi Thepla hot or warm or at room temperature.
- Enjoy Thepla with plain curd (yogurt), lemon or Mango Pickle, Mango Chutney, or Mango Chunda.
- You can also eat these with a simple Batata nu Shaak. These flatbreads also pairs well as a side snack with Masala Chai or Ginger Chai.
- Methi Thepla are best when enjoyed either right away or later the same day. They will keep well for up to 3 to 4 days when you make them without curd.
- So if you want to have them later after a few days, do not add curd as it will lessen its shelf life. Simply knead the dough with water. Store cooled flatbreads in an airtight container and keep at room temperature.
- They also freeze well. Simply wrap a stack of cooled Thepla in foil before storing in an airtight freezer bag, and keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.
- Thaw in the fridge and later reheat these flatbreads either in a skillet on the stove or in the oven for just a few minutes until warm.

451,Lassi Recipe (Indian Yogurt Drink),,"prep_step:
- In a blender take four hundred and eighty ml chilled curd (yogurt), crushed seeds from 3 to 4 green cardamons, one and one-quarter g crushed black pepper, 1 to 2 pinches of grated nutmeg, thirty g chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios or a mix of all three nuts.
- Add 10 to 12 saffron strands and 5 to ninety g chopped palm sugar (palm jaggery) or jaggery or sugar. Add about one-third to one hundred and twenty ml water.
- Blend until smooth and frothy. Check the taste and if needed add more palm sugar and blend again. Serve straightaway topped with a few saffron strands or chopped nuts.
- In a mortar, take the green cardamom pods and crush them lightly. Remove the husks and crush the seeds to a fine powder.
- In a bowl or pan, take fresh chilled curd (yogurt).
- With the handheld wooden churner ( madani )or blender or wired whisk, simply whisk the curd until it becomes smooth.
- Add sugar and cold water. You can also add cold milk instead of water.
- The consistency of this lassi is neither thick nor thin. For a thin lassi, add slightly more water and for a thicker version, add less water .
- Now churn or beat again with the churner, blender or wired whisk.
- Keep on churning or whisking until the sugar dissolves and you see a nice frothy layer on top. You can use an immersion blender for the same. Another way is to add all the ingredients in a blender jar and blend until smooth and frothy.
- Now add the crushed cardamom powder and saffron strands. Mix well. Do check the taste and add more sugar if required.
- As a substitute for cardamom powder, add rose water. You can skip all the flavoring ingredients, if you don't have any.
- Pour lassi in tall glasses and serve. Add a few ice cubes if you prefer. If you want, you can top lassi in each glass with 1 to thirty g of malai (the thick layer of cream which collects on top of heated milk) or 1 to thirty g of unsalted white butter (makhan).
- Garnish with a pinch or two of cardamom powder, 2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts like cashews, pistachios or almonds. Serve sweet punjabi lassi straightaway.
- Note that you could also make lassi in an electric blender, by simply blending all the ingredients – yogurt, sugar, cardamom powder, saffron and water or milk.
- Take the curd and water in a bowl or pan. Season with salt and roasted cumin powder.
- To make your own roasted ground cumin, dry roast cumin seeds in a small skillet or frying pan until fragrant. Then crush in a mortar-pestle or grind finely in a spice-grinder.
- With a wired whisk blend everything well till smooth. A blender or an immersion blender also works.
- Pour the salted lassi in glasses. Garnish with mint leaves. You can add a few ice cubes if you like. If you wish to avoid the ice cubes, then make lassi with chilled yogurt and cold water.
- In a blender take the curd, crushed seeds of the green cardamons, crushed black pepper, grated nutmeg, chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios or a mix of all three nuts.
- Add the saffron strands and chopped palm jaggery (palm sugar) or jaggery or sugar. Add water.
- Blend until smooth and frothy. Check the taste and add more palm sugar if needed and blend again. Serve straightaway topped with a few saffron strands or chopped nuts.
- Serve lassi as a refreshing drink during the daytime or serve it as drink it after any Indian meal.
- While serving sweet lassi, garnish with some chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds.
- Salted lassi can be topped with fresh mint or coriander leaves and a light sprinkling of roasted cumin powder, red chilli powder (cayenne pepper) or chaat masala.
- Store your leftover lassi it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. No need to add ice cubes if you plan to store.
- Scaling: All of the three lassi recipes can be doubled or tripled to make a large batch.
- Freshness: For the best lassi experience make sure to use curd that has not gone sour. The curd or yogurt should be fresh, cold and not rancid. I always make lassi with freshly set homemade curd and keep it the fridge for a couple of hours to make it cold.
- Flavorings for sweet lassi: For the sweet lassi recipe, you can add either cardamom powder or rose water or even adding both these flavorings work well. You could also choose to skip or include saffron in your sweet lassi recipe. Omit adding any of the flavoring ingredients if you don’t have them.
- Consistency: The consistency of all the three lassi recipe is neither thick nor thin. For a thinner consistency, add slightly more water but do not add plenty of water as this will dilute the flavors and the sweetness or saltiness. For a thicker lassi, add less water or do not add water at all.
- Sweeteners: For sweet lassi, sugar is the preferred choice of sweetener. But you can opt to add palm sugar (as I have done in the masala lassi) or coconut sugar or jaggery.

- Pour lassi in tall glasses and serve. Add a few ice cubes if you prefer. If you want, you can top lassi in each glass with 1 to thirty g of malai (the thick layer of cream which collects on top of heated milk) or 1 to thirty g of unsalted white butter (makhan).
- Garnish with a pinch or two of cardamom powder, 2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts like cashews, pistachios or almonds. Serve sweet punjabi lassi straightaway.
- Note that you could also make lassi in an electric blender, by simply blending all the ingredients – yogurt, sugar, cardamom powder, saffron and water or milk.
- Take the curd and water in a bowl or pan. Season with salt and roasted cumin powder.
- To make your own roasted ground cumin, dry roast cumin seeds in a small skillet or frying pan until fragrant. Then crush in a mortar-pestle or grind finely in a spice-grinder.
- With a wired whisk blend everything well till smooth. A blender or an immersion blender also works.
- Pour the salted lassi in glasses. Garnish with mint leaves. You can add a few ice cubes if you like. If you wish to avoid the ice cubes, then make lassi with chilled yogurt and cold water.
- In a blender take the curd, crushed seeds of the green cardamons, crushed black pepper, grated nutmeg, chopped almonds or cashews or pistachios or a mix of all three nuts.
- Add the saffron strands and chopped palm jaggery (palm sugar) or jaggery or sugar. Add water.
- Blend until smooth and frothy. Check the taste and add more palm sugar if needed and blend again. Serve straightaway topped with a few saffron strands or chopped nuts.
- Serve lassi as a refreshing drink during the daytime or serve it as drink it after any Indian meal.
- While serving sweet lassi, garnish with some chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds.
- Salted lassi can be topped with fresh mint or coriander leaves and a light sprinkling of roasted cumin powder, red chilli powder (cayenne pepper) or chaat masala.
- Store your leftover lassi it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. No need to add ice cubes if you plan to store.
- Scaling: All of the three lassi recipes can be doubled or tripled to make a large batch.
- Freshness: For the best lassi experience make sure to use curd that has not gone sour. The curd or yogurt should be fresh, cold and not rancid. I always make lassi with freshly set homemade curd and keep it the fridge for a couple of hours to make it cold.
- Flavorings for sweet lassi: For the sweet lassi recipe, you can add either cardamom powder or rose water or even adding both these flavorings work well. You could also choose to skip or include saffron in your sweet lassi recipe. Omit adding any of the flavoring ingredients if you don’t have them.
- Consistency: The consistency of all the three lassi recipe is neither thick nor thin. For a thinner consistency, add slightly more water but do not add plenty of water as this will dilute the flavors and the sweetness or saltiness. For a thicker lassi, add less water or do not add water at all.
- Sweeteners: For sweet lassi, sugar is the preferred choice of sweetener. But you can opt to add palm sugar (as I have done in the masala lassi) or coconut sugar or jaggery.",15,15,30,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

- Whatever you serve this snack with, remember to have hot masala chai with it.
- Use the amount of fat as specified in this samosa recipe to get a flaky crust.
- Add water just enough to help you form the dough. Do not make the dough soft like a bread or roti dough. The dough should be firm and tight.
- A soft samosa dough will make air pockets happen on the crust. Too much moisture in the dough makes the crust soft as well as gives it plenty of air pockets.
- You can shape samosa and freeze them or you can fry them until the crust becomes opaque and then freeze.
- The fried samosa can be kept at room temperature for some hours. If you are not able to finish them all, then store them in an air-tight container in the fridge for a couple of days. When serving you can warm them on a skillet or in an oven until warm (at 170 degrees celsius in a preheated oven).

458,Paneer Pakora Recipe,,"prep_step:
- Paneer: The best results can be achieved obviously with homemade Paneer . If using frozen paneer, follow directions on the pack before proceeding with the recipe.
- Slicing paneer: You can make decorative shapes from a paneer block, if you plan to make a large batch for a party. The shapes can be round, square, triangle or rectangle. I usually prefer to slice paneer in a square or rectangular shape.
- Spice levels: The spicing in my recipe is minimal. So, there is a balance in the taste and the pakora is not overly spicy. If you prefer, adjust the ground spices according to your likings. In fact, a pakoda is never spicy. The coriander chutney that is served with it can be spicy.
- Batter consistency: The batter should have a medium-thick to medium and flowing consistency, not thin or runny. A thin batter will absorb more oil, making the pakora loaded with oil and soggy.
- Leavening ingredient: I have not included baking soda or baking powder in this recipe. You can add, for fluffier and crispier pakora. About 1 pinch baking soda or one and one-quarter g baking powder will give you the best results.
- Baking and air frying: I’ve not had great results with baking or air-frying pakoras. But you can try. Bake or air fry at a moderately hot temperature of 180 degrees C (356 degrees F). Preheat oven or air-fryer for 10 minutes.
- Slice paneer into cubes or squares
- Add gram flour into a mixing bowl.
- Next add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, asafoetida, carom seeds and salt. Mix well.
- Pour two-thirds to one hundred and eighty ml water in parts and mix well.
- Use a wired whisk to mix the batter. Make a medium-thick to medium consistency, flowing and smooth batter without any lumps.
- Depending on the quality of gram flour, the water proportion will vary. You need to get a medium-thick to medium consistency flowing batter. Thus add water bit by bit and mix until you get a perfect consistency.
- Heat mustard oil or your preferred oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high heat.
- To check if the oil is medium-hot, add a few drops of batter to it. If the batter droplets comes up on the surface quickly and gradually, the oil is ready for frying pakora.
- When the oil becomes medium-hot, add the batter coated paneer cubes carefully in the medium-hot oil.
- When one side is lightly golden, gently turn over the pakora with a slotted spoon. Continue to fry the paneer pakora until golden and crisp.
- Remove the paneer pakora with a slotted spoon. Place them on paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining batches of pakoda in the same way.
- Serve Paneer Pakora hot or warm, sprinkled with some chaat masala and paired with coriander chutney or tomato ketchup.
- Batter consistency: Make a medium-thick to medium consistency flowing batter. Do not make the batter thin or runny. Batter with a thin consistency will absorb more oil making the paneer pakora soggy. If the batter is too thick, the outer crust will become doughy and dense.
- Soggy oily pakora: Frying at a low heat or in a warm oil will make the pakora absorb more oil resulting in an oily pakora.
- Burnt pakora: Frying in a very hot oil, will make the pakora quickly browned or burnt from outside leaving the inside batter undercooked and raw.
- Paneer: Homemade paneer is the best choice to make paneer pakora. If using frozen paneer follow the directions on the pack.
- Slicing paneer: You can make decorative shapes like round, square, triangle or rectangle from a block of paneer if you plan to make a large batch for a party.
- Spices and seasonings: The spicing in my paneer pakoda recipe is minimal. So there is a balance in the taste and the pakora is not overly spiced or spicy. If you prefer, adjust the ground spices according to your taste preferences.
- Oil: As I have mentioned above in the post use any oil that has a high smoke point for deep frying.
- Baking & air frying: I did not have great results when baking or air-frying paneer pakora. But you can bake or air fry them at a moderately hot temperature of 180 degrees celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit). Preheat oven or air-fryer for 10 minutes.

468,Puri For Pani Puri | Suji Ke Golgappe,,"prep_step:
- In a mixing bowl, take the fine unroasted sooji or rava or semolina, five ml oil, baking soda and salt. With your fingers, mix the oil evenly with the sooji.
- Now add all purpose flour to this mixture.
- Mix again very well so that the all purpose flour is mixed evenly.
- Add forty five ml water first. Mix again. Then add fifteen ml water more and begin to knead the dough. Sooji absorbs water while kneading. Add water in parts while kneading.
- Then add thirty g more of the water and continue to knead. The kneading is very important in getting the perfect texture. The dough is not soft nor too hard.
- If you make the dough soft, then add 1 to fifteen g more of the suji. If the dough looks hard, then add sprinkle some water and continue to knead.
- The suji puri dough should be elastic. Gluten strands need to be formed, which gives a structure and shape to the pooris. The correct texture of the dough, also help in puffing puris and helps in them staying crisp.
- Knead very well. Elasticity helps in rolling the dough without cracks and thinly. When rolling, the dough should roll easily without any cracks. You should be easily able to lift the rolled dough without it tearing or breaking and falling apart.
- Knead to a semi soft elastic dough and keep it in a bowl or pan.
- Cover the dough with a moist kitchen towel or napkin and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. You can also keep the dough for an hour.
- After 30 minutes, knead the dough again.
- Now divide the dough into two or three parts. Take one part on your work surface and begin to roll. Avoid adding any dry flour while kneading. Keep the remaining dough covered with the moist kitchen towel.
- Roll to a large round. There should be no cracks in the rolled dough. You can flip the entire rolled dough without it breaking or tearing apart.
- Keep on rolling to a thin and even round. The puri have to be thinly rolled. If not thin, the base becomes thick and remains soft even after frying. If the dough is not rolled evenly, then the puri won't puff up.
- With a cookie cutter or a small bowl, cut small to medium discs from the rolled dough. Using a cookie cutter gives even shape and size to the pooris. You can also make small balls and roll them. But then the puri won't have an even and uniform shape.
- Remove the dough edges and place the small roundels in a plate without them touching each other. Keep these puris covered with a moist kitchen towel.
- Collect the egdes and knead them lightly. Roll the edges too and make puris the same way.
- In this way make all the puris and keep them covered in a moist kitchen towel. You can also roll them and fry simultaneously like I have done.
- Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil should be medium hot. Add a tiny piece of the dough ball in the hot oil. If the ball steadily comes up to the surface, the oil is hot and the pooris can be fried now.
- Slid a few pooris in the oil. They will puff up quickly as soon as you add them to the hot oil. You can fry up to 4 to 8 pieces at a time, depending on the size of your pan.
- With a slotted spoon flip them, once they puff up. Even after oil stops sizzling, continue to fry till light golden. Frying this way, gives a crisp texture to the pooris from outside as well as inside. Otherwise, they remain soft from inside and crisp from outside.
- Fry them till they are a light golden or golden.
- Drain fried puri on kitchen paper towels. There will be a few flat puris too. These you can use to make sev puri or papdi chaat. Continue to fry all the pooris this way.

463,Veg Cutlet Recipe | Mix Vegetable Cutlet,,"prep_step:
- Rinse, peel and chop the veggies like carrots, potatoes, french beans.
- Boil or steam the veggies until fork tender in a steamer or pressure cooker.
- Drain all the water from the cooked veggies very well using a strainer. Set the cooked vegetables aside to become warm.
- When the veggies are cooling, blitz 4 to 5 slices of bread in a food processor or blender till fine to get bread crumbs.
- Set aside the bread crumbs in a plate or tray.
- When warm, transfer the cooked vegetables in a bowl.
- Mash them with a potato masher. Do not make a fine paste but keep it slightly chunkier with tiny bits of veggies. Set aside.
- Crush roughly chopped ginger, green chillies and garlic (optional) in a mortar to a semi-fine paste.
- Add the crushed ginger+green chili paste, red chili powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, chopped coriander leaves, bread crumbs and salt as required to the mashed vegetables.
- Instead of bread crumbs you can also add 2 to 3 slices of bread dipped in water and then squeezed completely of the water.
- Mix everything very well. Check the taste and add more salt or the ground spice powders if needed to the mix vegetable cutlet dough.
- In another small bowl, take all-purpose flour and water.
- Stir and mix this mixture to get a smooth paste or slurry without any lumps.
- Now take the cutlet mixture in a plate and using a cutlet mould, shape it or make small to medium-sized round cutlets by rolling and flattening the mixture in your palms.
- Take a cutlet and dip in the all-purpose paste gently so that the paste gets coated all over the cutlet.
- Then dredge the cutlet in breadcrumbs evenly and all over. Dust off any extra breadcrumbs. Crumb coat and bread each cutlet this way and set aside.
- If you do not have breadcrumbs, then you can also use rava (sooji or cream of wheat).
- Heat 2 to forty five ml oil for shallow frying in a skillet or frying pan. Dust the excess bread crumbs from the veggie cutlets sand place them in the medium hot oil.
- When one side is light golden or golden, flip and fry the other side. Add more oil if needed.
- Flip a couple of time more and fry all the vegetable cutlet till they are evenly golden and crisp from all sides.
- Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining cutlets this way add add more oil if required.
- Serve the cutlet hot or warm with mint chutney or coriander chutney or tamarind chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also make burgers, wraps or sandwiches with them.
- You can alter and use your own combination of spices in the veg cutlet, e.g you can add black pepper powder. You can make them spicy by increasing the number of green chilies.
- To make a coarse paste, you can just crush the garlic, ginger and green chilly coarsely with a pestle and mortar.
- As I have mentioned in the post, you can use rava (cream of wheat) to coat the veg cutlet instead of bread crumbs.
- Adding soaked bread or bread crumbs to the mixture binds the veg cutlet and prevents them from breaking while frying.
- To make the bread pulp, soak the bread in water briefly for a few seconds until the bread has become wet and soaked with water. Squeeze all of the extra water thoroughly. Add this bread pulp to the cutlet mixture.
- You can also shallow fry them instead of pan-frying. Deep frying these can be tricky.
- The veggies you can add are carrots, potatoes, green peas, french beans, cauliflower, broccoli, bell pepper and corn. Avoid using watery or mushy vegetables like pumpkin, various gourds, eggplant, okra etc.
- For some protein, you can add grated paneer or tofu, grated cheddar cheese or soya granules. Prep the soya granules as mentioned on the pack before you add them to the mashed vegetable mixture.
- If you have burger buns, you can easily make veg burgers. Just apply butter and slightly roast the buns. Apply mayonnaise on the bun. Place the veg cutlet in the center. Cover it with shredded or grated cheese or a cheese slice. Top it with shredded veggies like cabbage, carrots, and lettuce or thinly sliced veggies like onion, tomatoes, cucumber. Cover with the other half of the bun and serve with tomato or mustard sauce.
- The recipe can be scaled to make a large batch for parties.
- Note that the approximate nutrition info is for 1 vegetable cutlet.

- You can prepare the roasted chana dal flour at home. Just grind about fifteen g roasted chana dal (roasted Bengal gram) in a grinder till fine. Then, measure the flour using the standard fifteen g measuring spoon and sieve it together with the rice flour and besan.
- If you don’t have roasted chana dal flour, skip it. Use forty five g gram flour instead.
- Use good quality and fresh rice flour. The rice flour has to be fine and not coarse.
- You have to knead a soft and smooth dough. The quantity of water will vary depending on the quality of the flours.
- If the dough is slightly dry, the murukku will break in the oil. To correct this, add a few teaspoons of water, mix and knead again.
- In case the dough is too moist or wet, you will not be able to shape it properly. To correct this, add some rice flour and mix well.
- On tasting a murukku piece, if you feel it is too hard, add 1 to ten g butter. Mix and knead again.
- If the Butter Chakli looks very oily and has absorbed too much oil, add few teaspoons rice flour and mix again. This happens if the dough has more fat content than needed.
- Want to add some spiciness in these chaklis? Add some red chili powder or green chili paste to the murukku dough.
- Once you have added the murukku in the hot oil for frying, wait till they become slightly crisp. Then, touch them with slotted spoon to turn over. If you will touch immediately, they can break.
- Take rice flour, besan and roasted chana dal flour in a mixing bowl or pan. For roasted chana dal flour, grind fifteen g roasted chana dal in a small grinder or coffee grinder till fine.

472,Ragda Patties Recipe (Mumbai Style Ragda Pattice),,"prep_step:
- Soak the peas well : Use dried white peas (or green peas if preferred) and soak them for at least 8 to 9 hours or overnight before cooking.
- Use a pressure cooker : Cook the ragda in a stovetop pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Avoid using a regular pan, as dried peas take a long time to soften.
- Prepare chutneys ahead : Both green chutney and sweet tamarind chutney can be made 1 to 2 days in advance and refrigerated. This saves time during final assembly.
- Balance the toppings : Adjust the amount of chutneys and ground spices to your taste. You can also add a dash of lemon juice or some grated raw mango for tanginess on the assembled ragda patties.
- Optional curd topping : A spoonful of whisked curd (yogurt) can be added for a creamy element, though this is entirely optional.
- Cook the peas until soft and mushy : The dried white peas must be completely softened and cooked through. Depending on their age and quality, they can take longer to cook. Undercooked or hard peas can be difficult to digest and may cause stomach discomfort. Make sure the ragda is soft, mashable, and almost mushy as this gives the best texture and taste.
- Keep patties crisp : Assemble ragda patties just before serving to keep the potato patties crisp. If they sit too long under the ragda, they’ll turn soft.
- Scale as needed : This ragda patties recipe can easily be halved or doubled based on your serving size.
- Rinse the dried white peas a couple of times in fresh water. Soak them in 2.one thousand two hundred ml of water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.
- Drain all the water and rinse the soaked peas once or twice with fresh water in a strainer. Add the soaked white peas to the steel inner pot of 6 quart Instant pot.
- Add the ground spices – turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt. Also add the fifteen ml of oil.
- Place a trivet in the steel inner pot, ensuring that the top part of the trivet is much above the layer of water covering the peas. Place a pan containing 2 to 3 large potatoes (or 4 medium sized potatoes) on the trivet.
- Seal with the lid and the pressure valve positioned in the sealing mode. Pressure cook for 30 minutes on high pressure.
- After 30 minutes the pressure cooker will beep. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before releasing the valve.

503,Namak Para Recipe | Namak Pare (Salty Diamond Cuts),,"prep_step:
- Flour: For this recipe, I have used whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour. But you can use any one or the other, depending on your preference. I typically opt for whole wheat flour because it is a healthier option and the results are just as amazing.
- Dough: Make sure that your dough is the right texture to achieve the perfect results. The dough should not be too dry, as this may cause it to crack while rolling and will also make the texture dense. If the dough is too wet, then the Namak Para will be soft. To achieve a nice stiff and firm dough, add water in parts while kneading.
- Oil: I normally fry this snack in peanut or sunflower oil. Peanut oil adds a delicious nutty flavor while sunflower oil has more of a neutral taste. Feel free to use any of these 2 oils for the perfect results.
- Frying: Ensure to deep-fry these Savory Diamond Cuts in moderately hot oil. A less hot oil will make it absorb too much oil. If the oil is too hot, the snack will brown faster from outside. But inside will still be undercooked.
- Variations: This is a versatile snack that has a variety of flavors and textures. It can be spicy, herby, flaky or crispy. Depending on the amount of fat used in the dough, the resulting texture can be flaky or have a crispy hollow structure. Add spices and herbs like dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), crushed fennel seeds (saunf), nigella seeds/onion seeds (kalonji), asafoetida (hing), turmeric powder and red chili powder to make different yummy variations.
- Baking: To make a baked version of the Namak Para Recipe, add 3 to sixty ml of oil or ghee when making the dough. Keep the raw cut dough pieces on a baking tray. Preheat oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees F for 15 minutes. Bake at the same temperature for 20 to 25 minutes or until crispy and golden. If needed, turn over the pieces halfway, through baking.
- Scaling: You can scale the recipe to make a smaller or larger serving.
- Sieve the whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, baking soda and salt together.
- Add the carom seeds, crushed black pepper, cumin seeds and salt. Mix these spices and seasonings with the sifted ingredients.
- Add the oil or ghee. Add water in parts and start to knead the dough.
- The dough should not be soft, but firm and tight. Cover and set aside the dough to rest for 30 minutes. You can either cover the bowl with a lid or place a moist kitchen towel on the dough.
- Take medium sized balls from the dough. Roll them to a neat round ball between your palms. Place one ball on a lightly dusted floured surface or rolling board.
- With a rolling pin, roll into a disc or round neither too thin nor too thick and about 3 to 4 mm thick.
- With a serrated knife cut criss cross patterns on the rolled dough.
- Remove the diamond shaped patterns and deep fry them in hot oil till crisp and golden browned.
- Keep the cut pieces of dough covered with a kitchen towel, so that they do not dry out.
- Drain them on paper napkins to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining namak pare or diamond cuts in batches.
- Once they cool at room temperature, then store them in an airtight jar. These keep well for a couple of week when stored in an air-tight container or jar.
- You can serve Namak Pare with tea or as a snack.

504,Brinjal Curry Recipe (Baingan Masala),,"prep_step:
- Brinjal/eggplant (baingan): You can make this dish with any variety of small to medium-sized brinjals. Do not choose the large eggplant that is used to make baingan bharta or dishes like baba ganoush. Make sure the brinjals are fresh and not wilted. If there are too many seeds in the brinjal, then remove the seeds while chopping and discard them.
- Avoid too much bitterness: Brinjal or eggplant can have a very bitter taste. If you’re worried about this overpowering the curry, you can soak the brinjal pieces in salted water for at least an hour before cooking. This will draw out the extra moisture as well as bitterness.
- Blending or grinding nuts and seeds: Don’t over grind the nuts and seeds mixture. Grind at intervals, for a few seconds and then stop. Do not grind for a long period of time, as then oil will be released.
- Choice of fat: You can use peanut oil, sunflower oil or even any neutral flavored oil to cook this curry dish.
- Consistency: If the mixture starts sticking to the pan, then add some water and continue to sauté. You can have a slightly thick or a slightly thin consistency by adjusting the quantity of water in the curry.
- Substitutes: If you don’t have coriander seeds and cumin seeds, then use coriander powder and cumin powder instead. In place of tomatoes, you can even add some lemon juice or a bit of tamarind.
- Rinse and then quarter brinjals. Immerse the brinjal pieces in enough water in which two and one-half g salt has been added.
- In a grinder jar take white sesame seeds, peanuts, desiccated coconut, coriander seeds and cumin seeds.
- Grind to a fine powder. Grind at intervals for some seconds and then stop. Do not grind at a stretch as doing this will release oils from the nuts and seeds.
- Heat oil in a heavy pan or kadai (wok) or skillet. Add the chopped onions.
- Mix and then begin to sauté onions on a medium heat. Stirring often sauté onions until they turn light golden.
- Next add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds until the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.
- Reduce the heat to low and add the finely ground sesame seeds, peanut and coconut mixture.
- On a low to medium-low heat stirring non-stop sauté until the nuts and seeds mixture becomes light golden and aromatic. Oil will also release from sides.

481,Dahi Bhalla Recipe,,"prep_step:
- While making the batter for bhalle, you can also add five g roughly chopped ginger in it for an earthy taste.
- The quantity of water that needs to be added to grind the batter depends on the quality of lentils and the capacity or volume of the grinder. But make sure that you don’t add too much water as then the bhalle become too crispy and soak a lot of oil.
- Once the batter is ground, stir it briskly for some time as this will make the batter lighter and fluffier.
- Check the correct consistency of the batter with the floating test: add a teaspoon of batter in a small bowl of water. If it floats, it is perfect. It if doesn’t, it means the consistency is thin. To rectify this, add some sooji/rava or rice flour to the batter to thicken it.
- The oil for frying the bhalle should be at the right temperature. If it is too cold, bhalle will be soggy and if it is too hot, then the bhalle will brown faster from the outside and the center will be left uncooked.
- Use fresh curd for best results. To veganize this dish, use cashew curd. Also, keeping the bhalle dunked in curd for a longer time (atleast for 2 hours) makes the dish taste better.

483,Pav Recipe | Ladi Pav | Pav Bread,,"prep_step:
- If you can source, then try making pav with unbleached all-purpose flour. You can also make these fluffy dinner rolls with bread flour.
- The quantity of water to be added depends on the quality of flour. If the dough become sticky, then add some flour and if the dough looks dry, then add some water.
- Instead of kneading with hands, you can also knead the dough in a food processor or in an electric mixer with a dough hook.
- If the top surface of the buns browns quickly, then place aluminium foil or parchment paper on the top. This will avoid further browning.
- The leavening time depends on the type of yeast used and the temperature conditions. For instant and fresh yeast, keep for 20 to 25 minutes for the first rise. For dry active yeast, you will have to keep for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or more.
- Brushing the pav bread rolls with some milk gives a nice golden color to them on baking. You can brush the baked buns with melted butter too for a glaze.
- Once the Ladi Pav bread is baked, remove them from the tray and place on a wired rack so that they don’t soften or moisten from the bottom due to heat condensation.
- In a bowl take two hundred and forty g of all-purpose flour, instant yeast and sugar.
- Add two hundred and forty ml lukewarm water. Stir or whisk to make a smooth thick batter without any lumps.
- Cover and keep the bowl for 30 to 40 minutes till you see a bubbly and frothy layer on the top. The batter would also have risen.
- Add oil, salt and two hundred and forty g flour. Mix with a spoon or spatula.
- Next add 1.six thousand g flour. Mix again and then begin to knead for about 10 to 12 minutes.
- If the dough appears sticky then you can about sixty g flour more or as needed. The proportion of water to be added, depends on the quality of the flour. I added 3.six thousand g flour for two hundred and forty g of lukewarm water.
- Knead very well to a smooth, soft, supple and elastic dough.
- Place dough in a bowl. Spread oil or softened butter all over the dough.
- Cover the bowl with a lid or a kitchen cotton napkin and keep the bread to leaven for 20 to 25 minutes.
- Once the pav dough has risen and doubled, then gently punch and deflate the dough and form a neat log.
- Cut the log into equal sizes. Take each portion and roll between your palms to get a smooth round roll.
- Make rolls this way and place them in a greased tray keeping 1 inch space between all of them.
- Cover and allow the second rise for 25 to 30 minutes. The small buns would increase in size.
- Just before 15 minutes you bake the pav, preheat the oven at 200° C/ 390° F. For a regular oven, heat both the top and bottom elements. For a microwave oven with convection mode, preheat for 15 minutes at 180° C/356 ° F.
- Then brush the pav buns with some milk. This gives a golden color to laadi pav.
- Place the baking tray in the center rack in a preheated oven at 200° C/ 390° F for 25 to 30 mins or till the tops turn golden and the pavs sound hollow on tapping. For baking in the microwave oven at convection mode, bake at 180° C/356 ° F.
- Remove them from the tray (with a spatula) and place on a wired rack or wired tray, so that they don't become softened and moist from the bottom due to heat condensation.

484,Spring Rolls | Crispy Veg Spring Roll Recipe,,"prep_step:
- First cook noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.
- Once the noodles are cooked al dente, then drain the water from the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.
- Drain any water and set aside.
- Chop the veggies in thin long strips or matchsticks. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper (capsicum) in thin strips or matchsticks. For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.
- Please note you can use your choice of veggies.
- Now heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.
- Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.
- Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fry
- Add crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.
- Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.
- Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.
- Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
- Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.
- In a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.
- Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.
- Now take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.
- Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 to thirty g of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing.
- Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.
- Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.
- Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
- If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.
- Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.
- Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.
- Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it.
- While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.
- Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.
- Heat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.
- Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.
- Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.
- Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.
- Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.
- Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches.
- Garnish veg spring rolls with some chopped spring onion greens or coriander leaves (cilantro) if you like. Serve fried spring rolls hot with any dipping sauce of your choice like chili garlic sauce, hoisin sauce or tomato ketchup.

For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.
- Please note you can use your choice of veggies.
- Now heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.
- Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.
- Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fry
- Add crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.
- Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.
- Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.
- Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
- Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.
- In a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.
- Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.
- Now take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.
- Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 to thirty g of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing.
- Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.
- Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.
- Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
- If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.
- Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.
- Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.
- Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it.
- While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.
- Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.
- Heat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.
- Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.
- Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.
- Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.
- Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.
- Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches.
- Garnish veg spring rolls with some chopped spring onion greens or coriander leaves (cilantro) if you like. Serve fried spring rolls hot with any dipping sauce of your choice like chili garlic sauce, hoisin sauce or tomato ketchup.",20,20,40,,,,,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635,2026-02-03 15:31:24.139635

486,Eggless Mayonnaise Recipe | Veg Mayonnaise,,"prep_step:
- Cashews: Use raw, unsalted cashews—whole or broken pieces are fine, as long as they are not roasted or salted.
- Oil: A neutral-flavored oil is essential for the right taste. Opt for canola, vegetable, grapeseed, or avocado oil. Avoid strongly flavored oils like coconut, peanut, sesame, or olive oil, as they can overpower the mayonnaise.
- Mustard: Dijon mustard can be substituted with five g of ground mustard powder.
- Consistency: For immediate use, add only 4 to seventy five ml of water. The mayo will thicken upon refrigeration, so use 7 to one hundred and twenty ml water if you plan to chill it before serving. Using less water means you should consume it all right away, or it may turn too thick once refrigerated.
- Japanese-Style Vegan Mayo: For a sweeter, tangier version, increase sugar to fifteen g, mustard to ten g, and apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice) to thirty g. Follow the same preparation method.
- Storage: Store the mayo in an airtight container. It easily absorbs nearby odors, so keep it away from strong-smelling foods like cut onions or garlic in the fridge.
- Rinse cashews thoroughly in water. Drain all the water and discard it.
- Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with enough warm water. Soak them for 30 minutes.
- Drain and discard all the water from the soaked cashews and add nuts to a blender.
- Also add dijon mustard, raw sugar, turmeric powder, black peppercorns and rock salt.
- Add apple cider vinegar or lemon juice.
- Add the sunflower oil or any neutral tasting oil.
- While the blender is running, slowly add 7 to one hundred and twenty ml water in parts and blend until smooth and creamy.
- Pour your completed vegan mayonnaise into a clean jar or airtight container. Seal it tightly and refrigerate.
- This eggless mayo stays good for a month in the refrigerator. You can also freeze it for 3 months.

487,Paneer Kathi Roll Recipe (Paneer Wrap),,"prep_step:
- Paneer: Use fresh homemade paneer. Do not make this recipe with paneer that has gone sour or become rancid. If using frozen paneer cubes thaw them according to package instructions.
- Yogurt: For the marination, you can either use hung curd or Greek yogurt. Make sure the yogurt is not very sour.
- Cooking Paneer: Do not cook or pan-fry the marinated paneer cubes for a long time as this will result in them becoming chewy or rubbery. The paneer cubes can also be grilled in an oven at 180 degrees to 200 degrees Celsius, until lightly charred and golden.
- Spiciness: Adjust the green chilies as needed, to make a spicy or less spicy chutney.
- Veggie Options: In the vegetable salad, feel free to add your choice of vegetables – beetroot, onions, carrots, cabbage, bell peppers, lettuce are some good options.
- Wrap Options: The roti or paratha can be made from scratch as shown above or for a quicker take on the recipe, you could use frozen paratha or roti. Leftover dough can also be used to make the roti. An interesting variation is to use Pita Bread instead of a whole wheat flat bread.
- Scaling: This recipe can easily be scaled up to make for larger servings.
- In a mixing bowl take all the ingredients for the marination, except paneer.
- Mix very well. Check the taste and add more salt if required.
- Now add paneer, which has been chopped in cubes.
- Gently mix and let the marination coat the paneer cubes evenly. Cover and keep aside for 30 minutes. If keeping for more than 30 minutes, then refrigerate.
- Take all the ingredients for the green chutney in a grinder jar.
- Add five ml water (optional) and grind coarsely. Since the coriander and mint leaves are rinsed, the moisture from them helps in grinding.
- Then add thirty ml hung yogurt or thick curd.
- Grind to a smooth chutney. Remove in a bowl and keep aside. You can even refrigerate the chutney.
- Thinly slice onion, grate carrots and shred the cabbage or thinly slice them. Also thinly slice capsicum (bell pepper).
- Take all the veggies in a bowl. Add five g chaat masala, five ml lemon juice. Also add salt as per taste.
- Mix very well and keep aside.
- In a mixing bowl or pan or a large tray, take whole wheat flour, seven and one-half ml oil and salt.
- Then add one hundred and twenty ml water in parts. First you can add sixty ml water and add the remaining required amount of water later.
- Begin to knead. Add water as required and knead to a smooth soft dough.
- Cover the dough and keep aside for it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
- After 20 to 30 minutes, divide the dough into small or medium sized balls. This depends on the size of the wraps you want to make. You can also make mini wraps.
- Dust the dough ball with some flour. Then gently roll to thin roti. The roti should not be thick. If required while rolling, you can add some more flour.
- Place the roti on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook the base till you see blisters appearing on the roti or the roti is one-quarterᵗʰ  cooked. Do note that the tawa or skillet should be hot. So cook on a medium-high to high flame. On a low flame, the roti will become very crispy or hard.
- Then flip roti. spread some oil all over.
- Then flip again when the second side is one-half cooked.
- Spread some oil on this side too. You will see golden blisters on the roti.
- Flip once or twice more for even roasting. Remove and keep the roti in a roti basket or in a warm casserole. Prepare all rotis this way.
- Heat thirty ml oil in a pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low and add the marinated paneer cubes. Add the entire marination. Since I had used hung yogurt, I added the entire marinated mixture as the hung yogurt marination had coated the paneer pieces very well. But if you have used yogurt which has a thin consistency, then just add the paneer cubes.
- After a minute turn over the paneer cubes.
- Pan fry the paneer cubes turning often till the marination is cooked and the paneer becomes soft.
- Keep on stirring and turning them at intervals. Also use a well seasoned pan or a non stick pan, so that the paneer cubes do not stick to the pan while frying.
- I cooked the paneer for about 4 minutes on a medium-low heat. Do not cook too much as then paneer will become dense, cook on medium-low flame. Timing will vary with the thickness of the pan, intensity of the flame etc.
- Once the paneer is done, remove the pan from the flame and keep aside.
- Spread the mint-coriander-curd chutney over it.
- Now place the paneer tikka cubes in the center.
- Top with the veg salad.
- Roll both the sides of the roti and make a wrap.
- Wrap half portion of the rolls in butter paper or aluminium foil. If packing paneer roll for tiffin, then wrap the entire roll in aluminium foil and skip adding the green chutney and veggie salad.
- Serve paneer kathi roll with the remaining chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also add some of the veg salad as a garnish on the paneer wrap.

492,Onion Chutney Recipe (Tamil Nadu Style),,"prep_step:
- Onions: This chutney can be made with different types of onions such as red, white, yellow onions, as well as shallots and pearl onions. However, scallions (spring onions) are not suitable for this recipe.
- Spiciness: Adjust the heat and pungency of the chutney by using fewer red chilies or opting for less to medium-hot varieties. If very spicy chilies are used, the chutney can turn quite fiery. I prefer using Kashmiri red chilies, as they are mild and lend a lovely orange color to the chutney.
- Sourness: Tamarind adds a pleasant tang to the chutney. If you do not have tamarind, you can substitute it with lemon juice. However, the flavor will be slightly different.
- Nuts: You can add some roasted, unsalted peanuts for extra richness. Add them when the onions turn light golden and sauté for a minute. Once cooled, blend everything with water to a smooth consistency.
- Consistency: Adjust the consistency of the chutney to your preference. Add less water for a thicker chutney and more water for a medium-thin consistency. Avoid adding too much water, as it can dilute the flavors.
- Choice of Fat: Gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds) gives the most authentic flavor, but you can also use sunflower oil, peanut oil, or any neutral-flavored oil.
- Scaling: The recipe can be easily doubled or tripled to make a larger batch for potlucks, parties, or small gatherings.
- Heat oil in a pan. Lower the heat and add chana dal and urad dal.
- Fry stirring regularly until the lentils turn golden. Take care that you do not burn them.
- Next add the kashmiri red chilies. Fry for some seconds until you see the chilies change color and become aromatic.
- Fry on a low heat, so that the chilies do not get burnt. Kashmiri red chilies give a nice color and do not make the chutney spicy.
- Next add the chopped onions and chopped garlic.
- Mix the onions and begin to saute on a low to medium heat. Keep on stirring onions while sauteing them.
- Sauté until the onions turn a light golden.  Switch off the heat and let the onions become warm or cool down at room temperature.
- Transfer the entire onion mixture in a small blender or mixer-grinder. Add tamarind and salt as per taste.
- Add water and blend to a smooth paste. Set aside.
- Heat in the same pan or a tadka pan. Keep the heat to a low. Add mustard seeds and let them crackle.
- Once the mustard seeds begin to crackle, add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) and curry leaves.
- Fry for a few seconds until the curry leaves become crisp.
- Keep the heat to a low or sim and now add the ground onion chutney.
- Mix the chutney thoroughly with the tempered ingredients.
- Add water. You can make this chutney slightly thick or of medium consistency by adding less or more water.
- Mix very well and then turn off the heat.
- Transfer chutney to a serving bowl.
- Serve Onion Chutney with idli, dosa, rava dosa, medu vada, pakoda, or as a spread on toasted bread, sandwiches, or wraps.

494,Idli Recipe & Idli Batter – Tips That Actually Work,,"prep_step:
- Adding Poha: Add a handful of thick poha or cooked rice to the batter for a softer texture. This step is optional but makes a noticeable difference.
- Steaming in Muslin: Opt to steam them on a damp muslin cloth for a smooth, soft surface.
- Fermentation: Ensure the batter ferments well, with a pleasant, mildly sour aroma and visible rise.
- Rice Type: Use idli rice or an equal mix of parboiled rice (idli rice) and raw rice for best results.
- Lentil Freshness: Always use fresh urad dal; aged lentils can lead to a denser texture.
- Water Proportion: The amount of water should be perfect in your batter. Neither less nor more. Aim for the correct balance.
- Multipurpose Batter: The batter is versatile – make idli on day one, and Dosa , Uttapam , or Appe on the following day.
- Fried Idli : Deep or shallow fried till golden. Served with chutney or ketchup.
- Masala Idli : Sautéed idli cubes in a spiced onion-tomato masala.
- Idli Upma : Crumbled idlis stir-fried with mustard seeds, green chilies, and onions.
- Chilli Idli : Indo-Chinese style with capsicum, soy sauce, and spices.
- Podi Idli : Tossed warm idlis in idli podi with sesame oil or ghee.
- Idli Manchurian : Crisp-fried idlis coated in Manchurian sauce.
- Pick and rinse both the regular rice and parboiled rice.
- Rinse the poha and add to the rice.
- Add water. Mix well. Cover and keep the rice and poha to soak for 4 to 5 hours.
- In a separate bowl, rinse the urad dal and methi seeds a couple of times.
- Soak the urad dal with methi seeds separately in water for 4 to 5 hours.
- Drain the soaked urad dal. Reserve the water.
- First, grind the urad dal and methi seeds with sixty g of the reserved water for some seconds. Then add another sixty g and continue grinding until the batter is smooth, fluffy, and light.
- Transfer the urad dal batter to a bowl.
- Drain and grind the soaked rice and poha with water in batches to a smooth, slightly grainy consistency.
- Mix both the batters together in a large bowl or pan. Add salt and mix well using clean hands or a spatula.
- Cover and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8 to 12 hours or until it doubles in volume.
- Before you begin steaming, heat 2 to 2.one thousand two hundred ml water in an idli steamer, or a pot or pressure cooker until the water comes to a light boil or simmer.
- Grease or brush the idli moulds lightly with oil.
- Gently stir the fermented batter. Pour it into the moulds.
- Once the water in the idli steamer, pot or pressure cooker comes to a light boil, place the idli mould stand.
- Steam in a steamer or pressure cooker (without the vent weight/whistle) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the batter is cooked firm.
- To check doneness, insert a toothpick and it should come out clean. The surface should look set and feel springy.
- Let the idlis rest for 2 to 3 minutes, then gently remove with a spoon.
- Serve the steaming hot idli with coconut chutney and sambar.
- Store leftover idli batter in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Idlis can be refrigerated for up to 2 days and reheated by steaming or microwaving with a sprinkle of water.
- For regular rice variety – you can use sona masuri rice or parmal rice or basmati rice.
- Note that the approximate nutrition info is for 1 medium-sized idli served as is without chutney or sambar.
- Fermentation is one of the main factors to get soft, light and fluffy idli. Fermentations tips for winters listed below. Warmth: Place the batter bowl in a warm place – e.g near a heater or in a warm place in your kitchen. Oven: Preheat your oven at a low temperature (80 to 90 degrees celsius) for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then switch off the oven, keep the batter bowl inside and close the door. Lights in the oven: If your oven has lights, then keep the lights on and place the batter inside. Sugar: Adding a bit of sugar does help in fermenting the batter. In this recipe you can easily add upto five g sugar and don’t worry – these steamed cakes won’t be sweet. Salt: During winters, skip adding salt to the idly batter as salt retards the fermentation process. Rock salt and sea salt are good options to add in the batter. Fermentation time in cold winters: In winters, keep the batter for a longer time to ferment, like 14 to 24 hours or more. Do remember that even if you do not see the batter doubled or tripled, you should see tiny bubbles in the batter. You should also get the typical faint sour fermented aroma from the batter. Instant Yeast: You can even add one-quarter to two and one-half g of instant yeast (dissolved in 2 to fifteen ml of water) 30 to 45 minutes before you steam. But do this method when the batter has not fermented well. The negatives of this method is that you have to use all the batter at once. Even refrigerating this batter makes it very yeasty and sour. Baking Soda: You can also add one-quarter to one-half baking soda and then ferment the batter in cold seasons. Fenugreek seeds: Addition of fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) also helps in fermentation. Urad dal batter consistency: Urad dal has to be ground really well. Urad dal batter has to be soft, light and fluffy. So I suggest to grind both urad dal and rice separately to get soft and fluffy texture. A well ground urad dal batter also helps in fermentation. Also use urad dal which is fresh and within its shelf-life. Aged urad dal does not ferment well and makes the idli dense. Amount of water: Do remember to add the right amount of water in the batter. If the water is less, then the texture will become dense. Fermenting idli batter in Instant Pot: Press the yogurt option and use the less mode. Place a small trivet in the IP steel insert. Keep the bowl with the batter on the trivet. Keep the vent position to venting or you can use the Instant Pot glass lid. Set the time for 7 to 8 hours. On warmer days, the batter will ferment quickly. On colder days, it may take a few more hours for the batter to ferment in the Instant Pot.
- Warmth: Place the batter bowl in a warm place – e.g near a heater or in a warm place in your kitchen.
- Oven: Preheat your oven at a low temperature (80 to 90 degrees celsius) for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then switch off the oven, keep the batter bowl inside and close the door.
- Lights in the oven: If your oven has lights, then keep the lights on and place the batter inside.
- Sugar: Adding a bit of sugar does help in fermenting the batter. In this recipe you can easily add upto five g sugar and don’t worry – these steamed cakes won’t be sweet.
- Salt: During winters, skip adding salt to the idly batter as salt retards the fermentation process. Rock salt and sea salt are good options to add in the batter.

Do remember that even if you do not see the batter doubled or tripled, you should see tiny bubbles in the batter. You should also get the typical faint sour fermented aroma from the batter.
- Instant Yeast: You can even add one-quarter to two and one-half g of instant yeast (dissolved in 2 to fifteen ml of water) 30 to 45 minutes before you steam. But do this method when the batter has not fermented well. The negatives of this method is that you have to use all the batter at once. Even refrigerating this batter makes it very yeasty and sour.
- Baking Soda: You can also add one-quarter to one-half baking soda and then ferment the batter in cold seasons.
- Fenugreek seeds: Addition of fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) also helps in fermentation.
- Urad dal batter consistency: Urad dal has to be ground really well. Urad dal batter has to be soft, light and fluffy. So I suggest to grind both urad dal and rice separately to get soft and fluffy texture. A well ground urad dal batter also helps in fermentation. Also use urad dal which is fresh and within its shelf-life. Aged urad dal does not ferment well and makes the idli dense.
- Amount of water: Do remember to add the right amount of water in the batter. If the water is less, then the texture will become dense.
- Fermenting idli batter in Instant Pot: Press the yogurt option and use the less mode. Place a small trivet in the IP steel insert. Keep the bowl with the batter on the trivet. Keep the vent position to venting or you can use the Instant Pot glass lid. Set the time for 7 to 8 hours. On warmer days, the batter will ferment quickly. On colder days, it may take a few more hours for the batter to ferment in the Instant Pot.

quick_step:
- Adding Poha: Add a handful of thick poha or cooked rice to the batter for a softer texture. This step is optional but makes a noticeable difference.
- Steaming in Muslin: Opt to steam them on a damp muslin cloth for a smooth, soft surface.
- Fermentation: Ensure the batter ferments well, with a pleasant, mildly sour aroma and visible rise.
- Rice Type: Use idli rice or an equal mix of parboiled rice (idli rice) and raw rice for best results.
- Lentil Freshness: Always use fresh urad dal; aged lentils can lead to a denser texture.

- Water Proportion: The amount of water should be perfect in your batter. Neither less nor more. Aim for the correct balance.
- Multipurpose Batter: The batter is versatile – make idli on day one, and Dosa , Uttapam , or Appe on the following day.
- Fried Idli : Deep or shallow fried till golden. Served with chutney or ketchup.
- Masala Idli : Sautéed idli cubes in a spiced onion-tomato masala.
- Idli Upma : Crumbled idlis stir-fried with mustard seeds, green chilies, and onions.
- Chilli Idli : Indo-Chinese style with capsicum, soy sauce, and spices.
- Podi Idli : Tossed warm idlis in idli podi with sesame oil or ghee.
- Idli Manchurian : Crisp-fried idlis coated in Manchurian sauce.
- Pick and rinse both the regular rice and parboiled rice.
- Rinse the poha and add to the rice.
- Add water. Mix well. Cover and keep the rice and poha to soak for 4 to 5 hours.
- In a separate bowl, rinse the urad dal and methi seeds a couple of times.
- Soak the urad dal with methi seeds separately in water for 4 to 5 hours.
- Drain the soaked urad dal. Reserve the water.
- First, grind the urad dal and methi seeds with sixty g of the reserved water for some seconds. Then add another sixty g and continue grinding until the batter is smooth, fluffy, and light.
- Transfer the urad dal batter to a bowl.
- Drain and grind the soaked rice and poha with water in batches to a smooth, slightly grainy consistency.
- Mix both the batters together in a large bowl or pan. Add salt and mix well using clean hands or a spatula.
- Cover and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8 to 12 hours or until it doubles in volume.
- Before you begin steaming, heat 2 to 2.one thousand two hundred ml water in an idli steamer, or a pot or pressure cooker until the water comes to a light boil or simmer.
- Grease or brush the idli moulds lightly with oil.
- Gently stir the fermented batter. Pour it into the moulds.
- Once the water in the idli steamer, pot or pressure cooker comes to a light boil, place the idli mould stand.
- Steam in a steamer or pressure cooker (without the vent weight/whistle) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the batter is cooked firm.
- To check doneness, insert a toothpick and it should come out clean. The surface should look set and feel springy.
- Let the idlis rest for 2 to 3 minutes, then gently remove with a spoon.
- Serve the steaming hot idli with coconut chutney and sambar.
- Store leftover idli batter in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Idlis can be refrigerated for up to 2 days and reheated by steaming or microwaving with a sprinkle of water.
- For regular rice variety – you can use sona masuri rice or parmal rice or basmati rice.
- Note that the approximate nutrition info is for 1 medium-sized idli served as is without chutney or sambar.
- Fermentation is one of the main factors to get soft, light and fluffy idli. Fermentations tips for winters listed below. Warmth: Place the batter bowl in a warm place – e.g near a heater or in a warm place in your kitchen. Oven: Preheat your oven at a low temperature (80 to 90 degrees celsius) for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then switch off the oven, keep the batter bowl inside and close the door. Lights in the oven: If your oven has lights, then keep the lights on and place the batter inside. Sugar: Adding a bit of sugar does help in fermenting the batter. In this recipe you can easily add upto five g sugar and don’t worry – these steamed cakes won’t be sweet. Salt: During winters, skip adding salt to the idly batter as salt retards the fermentation process. Rock salt and sea salt are good options to add in the batter.

495,Tomato Rasam (Thakkali Rasam),,"prep_step:
- Tomatoes: For the best Tomato Rasam, use fresh, red and ripe tomatoes. You can use any ripe variety of tomatoes in these recipes. For extremely tart tomatoes, you can add some jaggery to balance the sourness.
- Lentil: Skip adding the urad dal in the Thakkali Rasam, if you do not have it.
- Spices: For a spicy and robust Thakkali Rasam, increase the quantity of whole black peppercorns by adding a total of two and one-half g.
- Choice of Fat: Traditionally, rasam is made with gingelly oil. It is nothing but wood pressed oil extracted from raw sesame seeds. In a pinch, you can opt to use sunflower oil, peanut oil or any neutral oil.
- Gluten free rasam: To make both these rasam varieties gluten free, skip the asafoetida (hing) or use a gluten free asafoetida in the recipes.
- Take roughly chopped coriander stems with or without leaves (about a handful of coriander stems) in a blender or mixer jar. Also add the peeled garlic cloves and roughly chopped ginger.
- Add cumin seeds and black peppercorns.
- Grind to a coarse paste or a semi-fine paste. Remove in a separate bowl or plate.
- In the same blender add the tomatoes (rinsed and chopped).
- Grind or blend to a smooth puree. If you want, you can blanch tomatoes and then puree them – for a bright red color in the rasam.
- In a heavy pan or pot, heat the oil. Keep the flame to its lowest.
- Add the mustard seed and let them begin to crackle.
- When the mustard seeds start to crackle, then add urad dal.
- Stirring often fry urad dal until they turn golden.

497,Mysore Bonda Recipe | Mysore Bajji,,"prep_step:
- Either whole & husked or split, husked urad dal can be used in this recipe of Mysore Bajji.
- For best results, make sure to use fresh urad dal and not the one which is old or aged. Urad dal that is not in its shelf life also takes a longer time to grind and doesn’t result in fluffy and soft bondas.
- The batter has to be thick and flowing, and not thin. With thin batter, bondas will be flat and will soak a lot of oil as well.
- Adding rice flour is optional and can be skipped. In place of rice flour, you can also add fine suji or rava (semolina). These help in resulting crispier bondas.
- If your batter has a medium consistency, then add some more fine rava or rice flour to thicken it.
- You can modify the quantity of spices, seasonings and herbs according to your likings. You can even omit adding some of them. Skip adding the asafoetida (hing), for gluten free bajjis.
- This recipe does not have any onions added to it. In case you wish to include it, then add about sixty g finely chopped onions in the batter.
- Make sure that the oil is medium hot while frying the bondas. If the oil is warm, the bajjis will absorb more oil. In case the oil is too hot, the bondas will brown quickly from the outside and leave the insides undercooked.
- You can easily double or triple the recipes of the bonda as well as coconut chutney to make for larger portions.
- First rinse the urad dal a couple of times in water. Then in a bowl soak the lentils in water for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
- Later drain all the water. In a mixer-grinder or blender add the lentils and water in parts. Grind or blend to a smooth and fluffy batter. First add forty five ml water and then add more as required.
- Using a silicon spatula take all of the batter in a bowl.
- Whisk the batter briskly for a 2 to 3 minutes with a wired whisk or spoon. This helps in aerating the batter which makes the bonda fluffy and light.
- Mix very well with rice flour, crushed black pepper, cumin seeds, chopped ginger and green chillies, asafoetida, chopped curry leaves, chopped coconut (optional) and salt as required.
- Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or fryer. Let the oil heat to a moderately hot temperature.
- Using a tablespoon measure or any small to medium-sized spoon, pour the batter in a round shape into the hot oil.
- When one side is lightly crisp and slightly golden, then turn over each bonda.
- Continue to fry the second side until light golden and crisp.
- Fry in medium hot oil till the bonda are crisp and golden turning them over as needed.
- Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on kitchen paper towels to absorb excess oil.
- Fry the remaining batches of bonda in a similar way.
- Serve mysore bonda hot or warm with coconut chutney.
- In a small pan, first fry the curry leaves in 1 or ten ml oil till they get crisp.
- Grind or blend all the ingredients mentioned under the coconut chutney list, together with the fried curry leaves and oil, with water.
- Serve the coconut chutney with the mysore bonda.

500,Chakli Recipe (Instant & Easy),,"prep_step:
- I recommend that you make the chakli on butter paper or parchment paper or aluminum foil , so that it’s easy to remove them.
- If the chakli breaks while forming them, this means that the dough does not have enough moisture. Add 1 or thirty ml of water and knead the dough again.
- If you are not getting proper spiral round shape this means that the dough is too moist. Add a bit of rice flour and knead again. Keep adding a few teaspoons of rice flour and kneading until the dough consistency is tight but still pliable.
- First take the rice flour and gram flour in a bowl.
- Add the carom seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, asafoetida and salt.
- Mix everything with a spoon.
- Heat butter or oil in a bowl or small pan to a slight simmer but do not boil or burn.

509,Cheese Balls Recipe (Indian Style),,"prep_step:
- Secret Ingredient! This cheese ball recipe is different as it has a secret ingredient – Gram Flour. It (also known as Besan in India) is flour made from husked & split bengal gram (also known as chana dal or black chickpeas). This flour not only helps the cheese ball stick together while frying, it also has the added health benefits of being high in protein and fiber. It also happens to be naturally gluten-free, meaning you can easily serve a wider audience. If you are unable to find gram flour where you live, you can use chickpea flour instead.
- No all-purpose flour: The recipe does not use any all-purpose flour, rather relies only on gram flour. Besan (or chickpea flour) is not traditionally used in a cheese ball recipe, so this was one of a kind when I posted it. Since sharing it, I have had a lot of positive feedback and I am happy to report that tasty, homemade, gluten-free cheese balls are being made in kitchens everywhere!
- Potatoes: Use potatoes with a high starch content. Russet and Yukon potatoes are a good option.
- Cheese: The recipe works very well with either cheddar cheese or processed cheese. For a more traditional Indian flavor profile, I suggest using grated Amul cheese, but cheddar or American cheese will work as well.
- Binding: Both gram flour and potatoes work together as binding agents. Before frying cheese balls, first test with a tiny cheese ball in hot oil. If it breaks, then you have to add 1 to thirty g chickpea flour or gram flour (besan) to the mixture and do the test again.
- Frying Temperatures: While frying, the oil has to be HOT. Otherwise, you risk the cheese balls breaking. The temperature of the oil should be from 180 to 190 degrees celsius (356 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Type of Cheese: For the type of cheese, I suggest using either cheddar cheese or processed cheese (grated Amul cheese would be most traditional, but American cheese should also work). Note: I am not sure about mozzarella (not the fresh kind), Monterey Jack or pepper jack cheeses as I have not tried making cheese balls with them. If you try using one of these cheeses in your cheese ball recipe, please let me know how they turn out in the comments below!
- Spicing: To make this a kid-friendly snack, I have kept the spices minimal. Feel free to increase the spice level if it suits your tastes. You can also add chili peppers (green chilies) or red chili powder to make these cheese balls spicy.
- Quantity & Scaling : The recipe makes 9 to 10 small cheese ball and can be easily doubled or tripled.
- Serving Suggestions : Cheese balls can be served as a party snack or appetizer. They also make a great snack or lunch for kids. Serve them with tomato ketchup, coriander chutney or mint chutney.
- Boil potatoes in a steamer or pressure cooker or an electric cooker. Boil the potatoes till they are completely cooked. You can even steam the potatoes in an Instant Pot for 7 to 8 minutes.
- When the potatoes become warm, peel them and mash very well in a mixing bowl. Allow the potatoes to come at room temperature before you add the remaining ingredients.
- Grate sixty g cheese and keep aside. In cup measurement, the amount is one hundred and twenty g tightly packed grated cheese.
- You can use either cheddar cheese or processed cheese. If using amul processed cheese, then use 3 cubes.
- To the mashed potatoes, add black pepper, crushed or black pepper powder, cumin powder, a pinch of garam masala (optional) and chopped coriander leaves or parsley leaves.
- Add gram flour (besan). You can also add all purpose flour or cornstarch (corn flour).
- Mix very well.
- Then add the grated cheese and two pinches of black salt. Add salt accordingly as cheese already has salt. You can even add rock salt or regular salt instead of black salt.
- Mix the cheese with the rest of the potato mixture very well. Check the taste and add more salt or crushed black pepper if required.
- Make small balls from the mixture and make one tiny ball to test while frying.
- Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.
- When the oil becomes hot, add the tiny cheese ball. The temperature of oil can be from 180 to 190 degrees celsius.
- The oil has to be hot, otherwise the cheese balls may break.
- When the tiny cheese ball, does not break , then you can easily fry the other balls. If it breaks, then you have to add 1 to thirty g gram flour or chickpea flour to the mixture again. Keep the same temperature while frying by increasing or decreasing the heat.
- Add the remaining potato cheese balls.
- With a slotted spoon, turn over when the balls get to become golden.
- Fry them till they are evenly golden all over and crisp.
- Once fried well, place them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil
- Serve hot with tomato ketchup or coriander chutney or mint chutney or any dip of your choice. For best taste serve them hot as soon as they are prepared.
- Scaling: The recipe can be doubled or tripled.
- Stickiness: The potato has to be drained very well. Even some moisture or water in the potatoes will make the mixture sticky.
- Binding: Instead of gram flour, you can add 3 to sixty g of all-purpose flour, chickpea flour, cornstarch (cornflour) or arrowroot flour. If while frying, the balls break, then add 1 to forty five g more of the binding ingredient as required.
- Frying: Fry at temperatures of 180 degrees to 190 degrees celsius. The cheese balls may break when frying at lower temperature.
- Spicing: As a kid friendly snack, I have kept the spices minimal. However you can increase the spices to suit your taste buds. You can also add spices and herbs like green chilies or red chili powder to make these cheese balls spicy.
- Type of Cheese: For the type of cheese, you can use either cheddar cheese or processed cheese or American cheese.
- Note that the approx nutrition info is one small cheese ball.
