- Once the gravy is thick yet of a pouring consistency, you may remove and discard the whole spices. Crush the kasuri methi in your palms and sprinkle it. (optional). Taste the gravy & add more salt if needed. Rest this aside.
- Option 1 – Grill in oven . Preheat the oven to 430 F or 220 C for at least 15 mins. Line a baking tray with foil. Thread paneer, onion & bell peppers alternately on skewers. Place the skewers in the baking tray & grill for 8 to 10 minutes, turning them to the other side after 5 mins. Remove them when golden and crisp.
- Option 2 – To make on griddle . Heat a tsp oil in a wide pan on a high flame, coat each paneer piece with the marinade & place on the griddle. Cook on a high flame till the marinade dries up and paneer turns golden. Similarly place the bell peppers and marinated onions and fry until the marinade dries up.

But if you don’t prefer that, you may use boneless chicken breast or thighs that are cut up to 1one-half inch portions. Cut down the cook time else they can dry out & overcook.
- You can make the dry spice blend without coconut to store for 3 months in the refrigerator or for 1 month at room temperature.
- You can make the Chettinad masala paste ahead and refrigerate for a week. Beyond the mentioned time, the spice blend begins to lose the flavors.
- Traditionally chicken is not marinated, but I prefer to do that as it removes the poultry smell. Yogurt or lemon juice helps do that and the spices in the marinade season the chicken well at this stage.
- Chettinad curry is not a tomato based curry, so you may cut down the amount of tomatoes if you want.
- It is essential to grind the spices super smooth else you will find the gravy gritty. Chicken cooks faster than mutton, so the gravy won’t get a lot of time to cook down & soften the grits.
- Marinate chicken with chili powder, turmeric, salt, ginger garlic and lemon juice or yogurt. Cover and rest aside until needed.

- Fine chop 1 medium onion, to make three-quarters to two hundred and forty g chopped onions
- Deseed & fine chop 2 medium tomatoes to make three-quarters to two hundred and forty g (or sixty g canned tomato puree (without citric acid) or use thirty g tomato paste stirred with forty five ml water)
- Always sauté & cook potatoes until half done before adding the cauliflower. Potatoes take longer to cook than cauliflower so avoid adding them together to the pan.
- Do not add salt till the potatoes are almost done. Adding salt will prevent them from cooking well since there is not much water used.
- The latter part of cooking has to be done on a low flame which helps the veggies to release some moisture and cook well without burning.
- If using tomatoes do not add them until the potatoes are soft cooked. The acidity in tomatoes will prevent the aloo from cooking faster.
- This can be made without onion, tomatoes, garlic & even green chili. I do make this baby version for my young boys as they are fussy to eat it with all those ingredients.
- My recipe shared here has all of the above ingredients and makes the best aloo gobi. However leaving out onion or tomatoes is just okay and the dish still turns out good. Leaving out both makes the dish very dry so use more oil.
- For a quicker version, just toss potatoes and cauliflower in spice powders along with little oil. Then bake them in a oven or air fryer. Make the onion tomato masala and then add the baked potatoes and cauliflower to the masala.
- Chop cauliflower florets to 1one-half inch in size. Add them to slightly hot water and set aside for 3 to 4 mins.

- Cook covered, stirring every few minutes, until both aloo & gobi are almost fork tender. Add salt and continue to cook covered on a low flame until the potatoes are soft & fully cooked.
- The veggies will release moisture at this stage and cook quickly. So keep an eye not to over cook gobi at this stage. It must remain slightly crunchy yet cooked.
- Next add the tomatoes and kasuri methi. Fry on a medium to high flame until the raw smell of tomatoes is gone.

- Rinse eggplants well under running water and wipe dry with a kitchen tissue. Make 4 slits on the brinjal. If you want to use the garlic & chili – push the garlic cloves deep inside 2 slits. Also push the slit green chilies in the other 2 slits. Brush them with oil.
- On Direct Fire : With the help of a tong, place it on direct fire. You can do it either on the red hot coal or stovetop. Keep turning it to all the other sides and grill until it is done completely roasted & cooked through. It takes about 12 to 14 mins.
- To grill in oven : Line a metal tray with foil. Cut each eggplant to 2 parts and place them on the tray with the skin side on top. You can also place the tomatoes in the same tray. Broil/Grill them at 460 F or 240 C for 16 to 20 mins.
- In air fryer : Place baingan, chilies, garlic and tomatoes in the air fryer basket. Air fry at 400 F or 200 C. It takes roughly about 22 mins for the whole eggplant, 16 mins if you halve the eggplant & air fry.
- Once done, check by inserting a fork into the eggplant. It should go in smoothly & easily meaning it is soft and cooked well. (Check step-by-step photos above)
- Cool the eggplant and peel the skin. Optionally – Transfer the eggplant to a bowl and cover it for 5 mins. Once done remove the skin.
- Mash or chop the eggplant, grilled garlic and green chilies. Keep these aside. Peel and chop the tomatoes, onions and raw garlic as well.

However it is a personal preference and you may omit it if you don’t like or simply use coriander powder along with red chili powder.
- For extra heat (spice) in the dish, you can use more green chilies. Adding more red chili powder will alter the flavor of the bharta.
- You can add half teaspoon cumin seeds to the oil before frying the ginger garlic.
- Use eggplants that have a smooth and glossy skin. Avoid over-matured eggplants with lots of seeds.

- The mixture for the patties must not be too soggy or too moist. Slight stickiness is alright but it has to be firm. If not add more bread crumbs. Check pictures in the step by step photo section in the post.
- Taste test the mixture and add more salt or any seasoning if you prefer. Divide the dough to 4 to 6 portions depending on how thick or thin you want the patties to be.
- To a small mixing bowl, add gram flour or corn starch to make the batter. Add a pinch of salt & pour water just enough to make a fairly thick batter. Do not make the batter runny as the excess moisture will be soaked up by the patties making them too soft.
- Pour bread crumbs or panko crumbs to a wide bowl or plate.
- Take one portion of the vegetable patty mixture and flatten it to the same size as your burger bun. If the mixture is sticking. Place the patty in some flour or corn starch. This way make all the patties and place them aside in a plate.
- Dip each patty in the batter completely and then place them in the bread crumbs. Coat the patty well with the crumbs including the sides.
- This way coat all the patties and set them aside. Rest these for 10 mins so the crumbs stick well to the patties and don’t mess the oil/ pan while frying.
- Rinse each lettuce leaf separately under a slow stream of running water. You may also sprinkle a solution of 1 part vinegar mixed with 3 parts of water. Rinse well and let them sit of kitchen tissues so all of the water drips away.
- Slice onions and tomatoes to round thin slices. If needed deseed the tomatoes.
- Refer notes section to bake or air fry the patties. To pan fry , heat a pan with 1one-half to thirty ml oil. Let the oil become hot, then place 2 to 3 patties as many as your pan fits. Rotate the patties with your fingers gently to coat the patties with the oil.
- Fry them on a medium high heat until the base turns golden and crisp. Flip them gently and pour 1 one-half to thirty ml oil as needed. Fry until crisp & uniformly golden. For a proper golden to brown crust, increase the flame the last 2 mins.
- To shallow fry , pour one hundred and twenty ml oil to a small pan and heat it. When the oil becomes hot, gently place the patties in the hot oil & fry until golden.
- Gently turn them to the other side and fry until golden & crisp. Remove them to a wired rack to cool slightly before assembling. To make cheese burgers, place cheese slices over the very hot patties.
- Once done with frying the patties, transfer the oil to a cup. Slice each bun to 2 parts and spread some butter on the buns if you prefer. Toast them in the same hot pan. Remove them and set aside.
- Before assembling please recheck – Lettuce should not have any water dripping, patties not too hot and the burger bun is also not hot.
- Place the toasted bun in a serving tray and then the veggie patty. Optionally spread the burger sauce we made earlier or some ketchup to keep the patty in place. However this is optional & skip if you want your patty very crisp.
- Place the lettuce, then the onion and tomatoes. Optionally drizzle some sauce over the lettuce and onions if you like. Spread more sauce over the top slice of your bun and place it over the burger.
- Burgers are ready to serve. Potato wedges, boiled corn, cheese balls are some of the great sides.
- Vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potatoes & sweet corn can also be used. Just steam them with other veggies.
- Mushrooms and spinach can be sautéed, chopped finely & then added to the mashed vegetables for patties.
- To make the patties completely breadcrumb free, use powdered poha, roasted gram flour (sattu), roasted besan or crushed cornflakes for binding. For the crumb coating, use powdered poha or crushed cornflakes.
- Spice them with any seasoning you like.
- Use vegan yogurt like this almond yogurt , eggless mayo or any vegan mayonnaise like nut mayo.
- Simply skip mayo and use guacamole or cream cheese or just any vegan cheese.

cook_step:
- salt (use a bit, only if needed)
- To a small mixing bowl, add mayonnaise or Greek yogurt, mustard, olive oil, garlic, chilli flakes and black pepper. Taste test and add salt if needed. If your mayo is not sour add lemon juice as well. Mix and refrigerate until needed later.
- Pour 2 one-half to seven hundred and twenty ml water to a steamer/ cooker or a pot. Place a trivet or a rack inside the pot. Cover and bring the water to a boil.
- Meanwhile rinse potatoes & French beans. Trim off both ends of French beans and fine chop them. Peel and cube potatoes to 1 inch pieces. Add them to a steamer basket and place them in the steamer.
- Steam them until half done for about 5 to 7 mins. Meanwhile, peel and chop carrots to 1 inch pieces.
- When the potatoes are half done, transfer carrots & peas to the steamer. Cover and steam them until potatoes are done completely and fork tender. Even peas and carrots should be done by now.
- Cool all these steamed veggies and transfer to a mixing bowl. Once cool mash them well and then add garam masala, coriander powder, green chilies, coriander leaves and salt.
- Mix all of them. You will have a mushy and sticky mixture. To this add, bread crumbs or powdered poha or flour in batches only as needed.
- The mixture for the patties must not be too soggy or too moist. Slight stickiness is alright but it has to be firm. If not add more bread crumbs. Check pictures in the step by step photo section in the post.
- Taste test the mixture and add more salt or any seasoning if you prefer. Divide the dough to 4 to 6 portions depending on how thick or thin you want the patties to be.
- To a small mixing bowl, add gram flour or corn starch to make the batter. Add a pinch of salt & pour water just enough to make a fairly thick batter. Do not make the batter runny as the excess moisture will be soaked up by the patties making them too soft.
- Pour bread crumbs or panko crumbs to a wide bowl or plate.
- Take one portion of the vegetable patty mixture and flatten it to the same size as your burger bun. If the mixture is sticking. Place the patty in some flour or corn starch. This way make all the patties and place them aside in a plate.
- Dip each patty in the batter completely and then place them in the bread crumbs. Coat the patty well with the crumbs including the sides.

- I haven’t used yogurt or milk in this recipe. But you can always use one of them. To incorporate milk or yogurt, simply blend the onions and cashews with either sixty ml yogurt or sixty ml milk to a smooth paste.
- Yogurt adds a mild tang to the korma and milk adds a different rich flavor.
- To make the recipe vegan, use more cashews, skip cream and paneer. Or you can also substitute cream with coconut cream and paneer with tofu.
- A lot of restaurants use canned pineapple for garnish. They taste sweet & delicious because they are canned with sugar syrup. If using fresh pineapple make sure it is ripe and sweet. Also adding sour pineapple is likely to split your korma since cream has been added to it.
- Skip the chili powder for a milder korma. Alternately add black pepper.
- Don’t overcook the paneer. You may add it directly to the hot gravy.
- Bring seven hundred and twenty ml of water to a rolling boil in a pot. Add onions and cashews to it and boil for 3 mins until the raw smell of the onions has gone. Turn off the stove.
- Remove the onions and cashews with a slotted spoon. Set them aside to cool and later grind it along with green chili to a smooth paste in a grinder jar.
- To the same hot water, add the cauliflower florets and leave them for 1 minute. Later drain the water and rinse them under running water. This blanching is done to get rid of any worms in the florets so you may skip this step if not required. Set aside.
- Heat five ml oil or butter in a pan. Add cashews and almonds. Fry until light golden and then add raisins. As soon as the raisins swell remove all of the nuts and raisins to a small plate.
- To the same pan, add paneer and fry for 2 mins. Do not over fry they turn hard and chewy. If you want soft paneer, Keep them immersed in little warm water until we use later.
- There are 2 ways you can prepare the veggies. The first method is to immerse all the veggies in 1.one thousand two hundred ml of water and boil them until fork tender.
- The other method is to steam them. For this bring four hundred and eighty ml of water to a boil in a steamer. Place the potatoes in a steam basket and stem until half done. Later add the rest of the veggies and steam together until just cooked. Do not over cook them.
- On a low flame, heat oil or butter in a pan. Add cinnamon, cumin, bay leaf, cardamom and cloves to the hot oil.
- When they begin to sizzle Add ginger garlic paste and fry until the raw smell has gone.
- Then add the ground onion cashew paste and cook until it turns thick to a mass and begins to leave the pan, meaning the paste is cooked well.
- Add the ground spices – chili powder, garam masala, turmeric and coriander powder along with salt.
- Saute until oil begins to separate from the mixture.
- Pour three-quarters to two hundred and forty ml water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until slightly thick. Taste test and add more salt if required.
- Add all the steamed veggies and cook covered for 2 mins. Pour cream and stir.
- Add fried paneer and nuts. Turn off the heat and add kewra water or rose water if using. If using pineapple cool down the navratan korma slightly and add the pineapple chunks.
- Garnish navaratan korma with coriander, pomegranate arils and raisins.
- You may skip the cream in the recipe by increasing the quantity of cashews to 18 but it won’t be the same.
- If your cream does not have any stabilizers, it may split if you add it directly to the curry. So temper it first by pouring the cream to a small bowl and then stir in a few tablespoons of gravy with it. Then add back the entire thing to the pan.
- This korma tastes sweetish and a lot of times restaurants don’t add any ground spice that imparts heat to it, like green chilies or red chilli is not added. So it is up to you. You can also simply add some crushed black pepper for the mild heat.
